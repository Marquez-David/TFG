% The following is overly complicated because I was not able to do so in
% another way. The problem is the bibliography command being "called"
% from both the root and anteproyecto directories...
%
% Here define as many bibfiles as needed
\newcommand{\mybibfileOne}{biblio/biblio.bib}
%\newcommand{\mybibfileTwo}{biblio/biblio2.bib}
%...
%\newcommand{\mybibfileN}{biblio/biblioN}

% This is for a single bib file
\newcommand{\mybibfiles}{\myreferencespath\mybibfileOne}
% but do this for multiple files
%\newcommand{\mybibfiles}{\myreferencespath\mybibfile1,\myreferencespath\mybibfile2,...,\myreferencespath\mybibfileN}

% Do not touch this
