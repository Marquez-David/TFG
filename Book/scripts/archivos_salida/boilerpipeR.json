(Manu Fernandez/AP)\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\nMADRID - Rafael Nadal kept Spain's hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give the hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\nGranollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5) to seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\nThe top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the series 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win, otherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a good position to advance.\"\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight hours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court. Spain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia. Russia beat Croatia on Monday.\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a position that you don't want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match, we were under pressure.\"\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic and Britain's Andy Murray will make their first appearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the Netherlands.\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group co-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also included a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd throughout the matches.\nUS FALLS\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after Vasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov defeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well, served well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American neighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\nFRANCE WINS\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year's Davis Cup runner-up.\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.\n\"We know we've arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of confidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win but we're really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\nARGENTINA CRUISES\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\"It's the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios' 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur's 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\nMore from Sportsnet\n"

        "texto":"Russia and Syria: U.S.-backed Syrian Forces Blocking Refugee Return\nshare\nThe Russian and Syrian defense ministries\n\"A cause for serious concern is the situation in southern Syria, where U.S.-controlled bandit formations, operating in the 55-kilometer al-Tanf zone, continue to prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp. The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure of American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to influence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants sabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of the humanitarian convoy's stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened families wishing to leave the camp.\"\nFalse\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria's al-Tanf of controlling \"bandit formations\" and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as \"patently false,\" and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\nThe al-Tanf base\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trump's announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer \"de-confliction zone\" on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established .\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\nThe Rukban camp\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm , is located in the desert near Syria's border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country's civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan's economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\"U.S.-controlled bandit formations\"\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT - formerly the Free Syrian Army - to fight against Islamic State.\nOmar Lamrani , a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University's Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry's allegations are false.\n\"I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not 'control' any actors there directly,\" Simpson said. \"From my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.\"\n\". prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp\"\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry's claim is \"absolutely not true.\"\n\"Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,\" the source said. \"Many people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.\"\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry's claim \"is patently false,\" and that \"the United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.\"\n\"Rukban is another example of the Assad regime's consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,\" Robertson said.\nHe added: \"The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.\"\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is \"working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.\"\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution .\n\"Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,\" Simpson said. \"This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.\"\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: \"The United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.\"\nMost popular\n"

As sure as pigs can fly Epstein isn't dead. In IsraHell by any chance, the refuge to be for all the Jewish trash and criminals?\n2\nAll materials\nWhat was this British royal and his PR aides thinking of when he granted a high-profile interview to the BBC, supposedly to clear his name from association with sex-trafficker billionaire Jeffrey Epstein?\nPrince Andrew, the nearly 60-year-old younger brother of heir to the British throne, Charles, has reportedly told friends and family that the interview aired at the weekend was a \"great success\".\nIn it, the British royal blankly denied having sex with underage girls supplied to him by the convicted pedophile Epstein who reportedly committed suicide in August while in custody in a US prison. The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but \"an articulated lorry crash\" performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein's sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\n\"Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,\" said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\"His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,\" the expert warned.\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein's \"unbecoming\" behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago - on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein's madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 - after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution - in order to terminate his friendship.\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein's orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: \"I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.\"\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were \"not close\".\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew's otherwise \"lack of remorse\" or \"sympathy\" with the victims of Epstein's sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\nLawyers for Epstein's victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let's see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time.\n"

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was\u00a0 sentenced to life in federal prison .\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\nTrending News\n"

        "texto":"By Tim Childers\n19 November 2019\nThe centers of massive galaxy clusters are super hot (red), while bright structures show diffuse gas from the intergalactic medium shock heating at the boundary between cosmic voids and filaments.\u00a0 (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\nThe formation of galaxies is a complex dance between matter and energy, occurring on a stage of cosmic proportions and spanning billions of years. How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology .\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter , gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\u00a0\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .\u00a0\nRelated: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through Time\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project , which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement . \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes . When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\nRelated: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n"

        "texto":"2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 8:15pm CST\nAudi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\nIt's a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\nAt the front, there's Audi's familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It's flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road - such as markings - with extra-precision.\nFor the rear, there's a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It'll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\nEurope will get the option of Audi's virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\nPower and Performance\nIn Europe, there'll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They'll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\nIt'll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to \"S\" and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It's enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\nQuattro is standard, and there's five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select - with seven different drive modes - will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\nRange and Charging\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It's worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\nStill, there'll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\nFor Level 2 stations, there'll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge - which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in - will also be enabled in 2020.\nInterior and Technology\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or \"frunk,\" you're looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker's twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There'll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi's phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there'll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it'll also be used to control a new \"functions on demand\" system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback \"edition one\": it'll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\nStory Timeline\n"

He didn't get it.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\nRead in app\nSend any friend a story\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\nGive this article\nBy Jamelle Bouie\nOpinion Columnist\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor's mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\"Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!\" Trump tweeted before Election Day. \"Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!\"\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. \"Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,\" he said .\n\"The people of this country aren't buying\" impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. \"You see it because we're going up and they're going down.\"\n\"You gotta give me a big win please,\" he said later. \"Please.\"\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points . Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory - their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago , when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.\nIt's true that Democrats didn't run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear - whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state - promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn't mean it wasn't in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president's allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president's immediate political fortunes.\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that \"President Trump's actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.\" And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense - Trump's attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival - was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he \"committed impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.\"\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication - proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president's wrongdoing.\nBut it's also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table - that there's still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president's phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn't be fishing expeditions - given the president's refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there's good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas - but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn't wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)\nI don't see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell's hands until there's a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there's the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what's been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It will house the local police force's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\" Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of civil servants, said in the statement.\nArchitects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for the building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials will pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior Ministry said.\nAlthough Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that it was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938.\nRecent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also perpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's rule.\nReuters\n"

(Paul Chiasson/CP)\nPete Borkowski @PeteB_93 November 11, 2019, 11:28 AM\nMilos Raonic has withdrawn from next week's Davis Cup Finals in Madrid with a back injury.\nTennis Canada released a statement on Monday morning announcing that the world No. 31 will be unable to participate in first edition of the revamped international team competition.\nRaonic has struggled all season with the back injury, only playing five matches since the Rogers Cup in August, where he retired from his second-round match against countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime because of it. The injury also forced him to miss both the French Open and U.S. Open in 2019.\n\"It is very hard and disappointing for me that I will not be able to represent my country at Davis Cup,\" Raonic said in the statement. \"My health has continued to let me down through this entire year and now once again. I will take the appropriate time to get healthy and I look forward to being back on court next season.\"\n\"I believe in my teammates, and I know they'll give everything to secure Canada's first Davis Cup title. I'll be following them very closely and I wish them the best.\"\nRaonic has only appeared for Canada in Davis Cup play since 2015 once, that being the 2018 World Group playoffs.\nWorld No. 94 Brayden Schnur of Toronto will take Raonic's place on the four-man team which includes world No. 15 Denis Shapovalov, No. 21 Auger-Aliassime, and No. 149 Vasek Pospisil.\n\"I'm very happy to be able to play in the Davis Cup Finals but, of course, I first want to wish Milos a speedy recovery,\" said Schnur in the Tennis Canada statement. \"It's an honour for me to represent Canada in this team competition. We know every win will be hard-won but I'm ready to support my teammates and go all the way.\"\nSchnur reached his first ATP Tour final as a qualifier in February at the New York Open, losing in a third set tiebreak to Reilly Opelka. He also reached three ATP Challenger Tour finals in 2019, most recently falling to his new Davis Cup teammate Pospisil in Charlottesville two weeks ago.\nIt will be the Toronto-native's second appearance for Canada at the Davis Cup. He lost both his singles matches in the 2017 World Group Playoffs against India, although Canada won the tie.\nAuger-Aliassime and Pospisil have also suffered injuries in the last month, but both are still expected to play next week.\nThe Davis Cup Finals will take place from Nov. 18 to 24 at the Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain.

It is up to them to de-escalate, as others should tell them\n'Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement.' Photograph: AFP via Getty\n'Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement.' Photograph: AFP via Getty\nMon 18 Nov 2019 18.54 GMT\nLast modified on Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.56 GMT\nHong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is \"absolutely no room for compromise\". But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police , who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message - no way out - was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong's legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched \"save the students\" marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong's way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People's Liberation Army took to the city's streets to clear barricades this weekend: a \"voluntary clean-up activity\" which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\nThe movement's resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to \"show absolutely no mercy\" in the \"struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\". Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the \"Belfastisation\" of the city.\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing's chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan's incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year's election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\nChina's leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible - but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain . Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\nTopics\n"

Learn more\n(Reuters) - The New York State Attorney General (NYAG) is investigating WeWork, according to two people familiar with the matter, adding to a mounting series of problems that have turned the workspace provider from a Wall Street darling into a pariah in a matter of weeks.\nThe company, which is expected to lay off thousands of employees beginning this week as it faces ballooning losses, confirmed on Monday that it had been contacted by the office of the NYAG, Letitia James.\n\"We received an inquiry from the office of the New York State Attorney General and are cooperating in the matter,\" said a WeWork spokesperson when contacted by Reuters.\nA spokesperson for the NYAG declined to comment.\nAmong the issues the NYAG is examining is whether WeWork's founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, indulged in self-dealing to enrich himself.\nNeumann bought properties that he then leased back to WeWork, borrowed against his own stake in the company, and had also planned to charge WeWork almost $6 million to use his trademark of the word \"We\" after the company rebranded itself The We Company.\nThe company shelved its plans for an initial public offering on September 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, its business model, and its corporate governance.\nNeumann had resigned as CEO the previous week.

SoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to fund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for some of Neumann's shares.\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later this week in areas that do not support WeWork's core business goals, said The We Company's recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters.\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000 jobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.\nNext steps to shape the company's future will be divulged in an all-company meeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization to grow. \"We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities,\" added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWork's venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units.\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG.

        "texto":"The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31pm CST\nVolkswagen's first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn't expected until next year, but the automaker isn 't slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it's weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe.\nThe MEB's flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is - at 195-inches - about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it's narrower and lower.\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it's enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There's electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph.\nAs for range, in RWD form you're looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle.\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW's engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That's also where you'll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo.\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they're eyes opening.\nInside, there's seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there's AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it'll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There's a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW's 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too.\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that's still cost effective.\nStory Timeline\n"

        "texto":"Key moments from Kurt Volker's and Tim Morrison's impeachment hearing testimony\nBy Stefan Becket, Kathryn Watson, Grace Segers\nNovember 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n/ CBS News\nKurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council official, testified side-by-side before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday about the events at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he wasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\nRepublicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\"My fears have been realized\"\nDay 3, Part 10: Morrison's opening statement 05:22\nMorrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.\"\u00a0\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\nVolker: Biden allegations are \"not credible\" 03:05\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.\n3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\nVolker says he used \"official\" channel 00:53\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\u00a0\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"\n4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman 03:17\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton - Morrison's supervisor - to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\nVolker: Nothing unusual about hold on aid 02:24\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\u00a0\n6. \"The Gordon problem\"\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n7. \"The Giuliani problem\"\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\u00a0\n"

She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n\"We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,\" Cooper said. \"They start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren't paid enough.\"\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state's $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\"The crisis is now, and we need action now,\" Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. \"The issue is funding, and the state has the money.\"\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn't estimate how many total were on the grounds.\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don't expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, \"Red for Ed,\" in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state's new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring - one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n\"We get that you're frustrated,\" Bosma said. \"We get that you are concerned about issues.\"\nTeachers didn't see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb's 2016 election campaign.\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state's private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren't \"asking for the moon.\"\n\"What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,\" she said.\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana's Richmond High School, said politicians have \"vilified\" educators.\n\"They think they know better about education than us,\" he said. \"They don't trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we're in the classroom.\"\n"

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\u00a0\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson , however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\u00a0\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. . You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds .\u00a0\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season.

The Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC defense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they have a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in desperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of the year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can do, though Spanos will mess it up.\n"

        "texto":"Air pollution is once again surging in Delhi. It's part of a larger pollution problem in India.\nSanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nYet another cloud of choking smoke and dust descended this year upon the 20 million residents of Delhi as winter crept in, reaching \"severe\" or \"emergency\" levels throughout the region. The dangerous, dirty air arose from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over India's capital region.\nIn November, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter to describe his city as a \"gas chamber.\"\nDelhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states\nIt is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today\nI urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights , closed schools , and created a public health emergency . The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren .\nSome air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day . The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported that the air quality index earned a rating of \"hazardous\" at points throughout November.\nAir pollution in Delhi reached \"unhealthy\" to \"hazardous\" levels this November.\nBerkeley Earth\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it's part of a dangerous pollution problem in India . The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 - particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems - were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths . Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure . With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities , the risk is worsening for Indians.\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.\nWhy Delhi's air pollution gets so bad this time of year\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And in November in Delhi, there's a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi's more than 10 million vehicles , like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors.  Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region's total pollution. Dust from the city's construction boom is also a contributor to the city's smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation .\nThese sources contribute to Delhi's year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse in the winter.\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n- Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi's pollution in November isn't coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. \"It's like you're pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that's plugged up,\" Apte said. \"It overflows with spectacular consequences.\"\nDelhi's air wasn't always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\n\"I'm actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,\" said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. \"The [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?\"\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India's breadbasket , and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality.\nSakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act .\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab's water table . But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat , which is typically sown mid-November.\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can't hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting - burning crop stubble.\nThis satellite image from NASA's worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.\nNASA Worldview\nOf course, it's not just rural pollution that's choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution - traffic, construction, cooking fires - have also increased as the region's population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\nBrick kilns and factories were shut down. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\nIndia's Supreme Court also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires continued , showing that enforcement remains a problem.\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it's because of shifts in the weather - not policy.\n\"This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi's air to slightly improve,\" Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News .\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.\nSonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. \"Part of the challenge is that there's a character of 'Oh no, you first,' 'No, you first,'\" Apte said. \"No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.\"\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution - many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds .\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India's last election cycle . And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\"People will be up in revolt, they'll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,\" Prakash said. \"It's actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.\"\nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve . Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\nEcological Economics\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China's air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics , it gets done.  The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\"The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,\" Prakash said. \"Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.\"\nThat's not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. \"If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,\" Prakash said. It's not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\nBiplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan , and Lagos, Nigeria . \"The problem can be solved,\" Prakash said. \"But what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.\"\nWill you support Vox's explanatory journalism?\nMillions turn to Vox to understand what's happening in the news.

For this years' edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme 'The Medium is the Message'. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition - in the historical center of Amsterdam - which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\nCover image: artist's impression of the lighting installation by\u00a0Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\nIvana Jelic and Pavle Petrovic (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh's famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) - also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua - explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio's innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli,\u00a0Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years' exhibition revolves around the theme 'The Medium is the Message', the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\nSome of the lighting installations on\u00a0show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival - previews\nLight a Wish by OGE Group\nParabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo\nPortam Civitatis by Peter Snijder\nSpider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS\n7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019\nsponsored links\n"

The demand has US\u00a0officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US\u00a0farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\u00a0maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US\u00a0put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\nTrump and US\u00a0Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US\u00a0on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\u00a0\n"

Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\nIt is for that reason that the United States 's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry's upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's\u00a0 Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\"We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,\" Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\"This is based on our objectives, the agency's objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,\" he said.\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA's Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted \"technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays \". The report and Monday's announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency's 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\nIn May, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter's moon Europa, as NASA's scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon's icy crust.\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\nCloser to home, NASA's Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth's moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year's original list.\n\"We're honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,\" said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. \"It's very exciting times. We're using our Blue moon lander, which is [a] big one.\"\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics Inc and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\"Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,\" said Michael Sims, CEO and founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\"There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.\"\nSource: Al Jazeera\n"

        "texto":"Review by Sherif Saed Staff Writer\nPublished on\n20 Nov, 2019\nEven if its core components are owed to other games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order finds a reason for their inclusion and stops just short of greatness.\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is game that is many things to different people. You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\nIt's Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it's even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\nWhere it's easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\nFallen Order's story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game's entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era's biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\nOne of the narrative's strongest elements is that it doesn't rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There's one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn't matter to the general story.\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez's ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year's best new character.\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction - and my god, every little animation he plays - both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2's BT-7274.\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn't so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\nWatch on YouTube\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\nThis means you'll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn't shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don't always need to follow the quest marker if you don't want to.\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it's great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It's not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware's work, which is what makes the map - available to you at any point - such a lifesaver.\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren't. They're even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It's a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake's map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn't exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\nIn your adventures, you'll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they're often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however - units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they're mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\nThe best new character in 2019.\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\nYou're going to parry the basic trooper's bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You'll watch for the melee trooper's very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you'll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you'll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you're not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\nFallen Order's combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don't have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you'll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It's a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution.\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you'll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it's boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There's often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents' guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry.\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can't cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don't really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They'll often continue their combo unabated and you'll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren't working.\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn't fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack.\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could've soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn't hook me.\nWatch on YouTube\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all - at the game's worst moments - lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually - but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren't enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I've certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don't always win.\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting - but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\nAnd yes, it doesn't always get there in this one, but damn If I can't help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It's worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn't settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent - albeit flawed - combat.\nVersion tested: PC.\n"

        "texto":"Copy Link URLCopied!\nPrint\nWalt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer said overwhelming demand and a computer-coding glitch led to widespread problems last week when the Burbank entertainment giant launched Disney+ .\nThe company struggled to contend with the more than 10 million users who activated their accounts last Tuesday. Disney's $6.99-a-month service is stocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, \"Star Wars,\" Marvel Studios and classic Disney fare, including \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Bambi.\"\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had forgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others  reported being abruptly logged off the service.\n\"We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn't make me feel good,\" Mayer, Disney's chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media's Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\nAdvertisement\nDisney's tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and \"patched\" the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week.\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming service\n(Walt Disney Co.)\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial, although it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\"We've never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see \" Mayer said.\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney's business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered  its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney's  flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game.\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\"We will see the industry shake out a bit,\" Mayer said. \"Not everyone will succeed.\"\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services  consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\"There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,\" Mayer said. \"We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.\"\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer's mettle. He is viewed as a potential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the design and last week's rollout of the service.\nMayer was named chairman of Disney's direct-to-consumer and international division in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and corporate strategy executive at the company.\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and BamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological backbone of Disney's streaming efforts.\nIt's the first time in Mayer's career with Disney that he has been in a hands-on operational role.\n\"Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,\" Mayer said. \" I love what I'm doing.\"\n"

(AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes)\nBy Bill Hoppe | Special to the Pioneer Press\nPUBLISHED:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:59 p.m.\n| UPDATED:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:16 p.m.\nBUFFALO, N.Y. - Hours before Zach Parise's two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he always finds a way to start scoring.\n\"It takes a little longer now, but he's playing well now, he's getting a little bit of confidence back,\" Boudreau said before the Wild's 4-1 win over the Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. \"That goes a long way.\"\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is brimming with confidence.\nParise's first-period goals - he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56 - gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn't relinquish.\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third period.\n\"That's perfect,\" Boudreau said. \"It's the mark of a true competitor doing things for the team.\"\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise's penchant for changing sticks, could see the frustration on his friend's face.\n\"He's used to scoring goals, getting points,\" he said.\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games.\n\"You can go either way,\" Parise said. \"I was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.\"\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek's feed on a two-on-one.\nHe tipped Suter's shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\"He's starting to feel it a little bit again,\" Boudreau said. \"And we need those goals.\"\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\"It's hard not to, though,\" Suter acknowledged. \"We know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.\"\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to \"believe in yourselves\" and that the Wild are a \"good team.\"\n\"You've beaten some really good teams this year,\" he said he said he told them. \"You've been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\"I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren't playing good.\"\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\"I didn't really see him coming,\" Eriksson Ek said. \"He came off my back and, like, I just wasn't ready for it.\"\nParise said: \"We've been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.\"\nEichel said he was \"just trying to spark some energy.\"\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period.\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker's empty-net goal sealed it.\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury.\n\"I haven't talked to the trainers at all,\" Boudreau said.\nSign up for Newsletters and Alerts\n"

Black Friday is approaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black Friday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\nPS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\nGet it on Amazon for 39.99\nNintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even on Black Friday).\nGet it at Walmart for $238.99\nKing of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R Curved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming monitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely love it, both for work and for games.\nGet it on Amazon for $649.99\nNew Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99 (Originally $200)\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most people probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\nAlso at Walmart\nNew Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped today to the lowest price we've ever seen.\nAlso at Walmart\n45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift card, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're essentially getting it for $499.\nDell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD for $799.99\nUse code \"50OFF699\"\nThis is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\nNetgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\nClip the $10 off coupon on the product page\nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\nGet Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\nThis sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to uncover your login info one day-and if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019 . Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\nDownload Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don't have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\nGet 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n$10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\nGet it at Walmart for $249.95\nNew Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with Bonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\nGet it by itself on Amazon for $199\nNew Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon Credit\n\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review .\nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but we confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it will end very, very soon so hurry!\nGet Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday season.  This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\nGet it at Walmart for $499.99\n$15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\nGet it on Amazon for $234.98\n30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City 2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.\nGet it on Amazon for $243.97\nDisney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package and Save $5/Month\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription.

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device.\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front.\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"-and someone he's learned a lot from.\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs.\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company.\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices .\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don't even own a computer anymore and I don't need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\"\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff.\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader.\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said.\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented.\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\"\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\nRelated Topics:\n"

One of Alibaba's New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\nThe Chinese company's decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city's status as a Asian financial hub.\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba's initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company's unusual governance structure.\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.\nHong Kong's exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\nAlibaba's listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.\nMain image credit: Getty\n"

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\u00a0\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier . Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline - the largest international carrier in the world - will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production . Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n"

        "texto":"An artist's illustration of a plume of water vapor emanating from Jupiter's moon Europa. (Image credit: NASA/ESA/K. Retherford/SWRI)\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa , which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system . But the third - liquid water - is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\nRelated: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life .\u00a0\nThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights -\u00a0April 26, 2016 - they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\u00a0\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff -\u00a0about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper , which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus , which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.\nNASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper , which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years -\u00a0 or if they just get really lucky.\u00a0\n"

Mr. Trump's tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president's \"mercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team\" had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. \"By hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,\" he said.\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests . Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States \"farm country,\" but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president's unpredictable behavior - as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking.\nImage\nPresident Trump met with North Korean President Kim Jong-un in Hanoi in February.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump's efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect - or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\n\"It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,\" said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. \"It really doesn't fit well with the world of global supply chains. And we're talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\"\nEven Mr. Trump's supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesn't want the show to end.\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced \"near-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardship\" stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying \"time is running out for many in agriculture.\"\nBut Mr. Trump's approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested - larger purchases \"than any time in our history, by far\" - into the actual text of a trade agreement.\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries', as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\nMr. Trump's tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached.\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China's top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.\n\"Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?\" He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\nAdvertisement\n"

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009's Star Trek and 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film.\nThis will be Hawley's second film\nThe fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016 , with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pine's Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actors' schedules shift. It's unclear whether Hawley's film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return - both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter . The Wrap's report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn't mention Hemsworth.\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so it's possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things weren't murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino , which has been rumored since 2017.\nThe fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawley's second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics - and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo .\nNo release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced.\nNext Up In Tech\nSign up for the                    newsletter Verge Deals\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nJust one more thing!\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\nEmail (required)\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Notice and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nSubscribe\n"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer considers settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but the Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\nHighlights\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\nThe United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement.\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel.\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body.\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added.\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees.\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\u00a0\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\".\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel.\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us.

        "texto":"Share this article on Tumblr\nGoogle 's long-gestating foray into gaming has finally arrived as the tech giant's game streaming service, Stadia, launched Tuesday morning.\u00a0\n\"Stadia has been built from the ground up to be a cloud platform,\" Jack Buser, director for games at Google, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"You're going to see a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other platforms.\"\nGoogle's gaming offering, which is offered at a $9.99 monthly rate for its Stadia Pro subscription (there is also a $129.99 Premiere Edition available for preorder that includes a controller, Chromecast Ultra and three months of Stadia Pro and a free tier of the Stadia service is due out next year), is centered on the growing industry of game streaming, allowing players to access AAA titles while on-the-go through their smart phone device, tablet or computer, as well as their TV. The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is Google's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\u00a0\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google's planned 'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community.and that should seed interest in the Founder's Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there's a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don't own a console or PC join in.\"\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We're excited by the opportunity and we'll see how it goes.\"\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\u00a0\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you're not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we're getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that's xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we'd look at.\"\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\u00a0\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward.\u00a0\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you'll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You'll never download a game or have to download an update.\u00a0We're already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven't seen it in games yet.\u00a0It's tough to go back to console.\"\nRead More About:\n"

The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack.\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don't much care for.\n\"Since 2008, there hasn't been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,\" says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That's produced a strategy of \"continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.\" The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in \"synergies\" from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it \"immaterial\" ) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred .\nColumn: A vulture firm's bid for Gannett shows there's still value in newspapers - for plundering\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society - especially local journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians' hands out of the public cookie jar - Alden Global Capital is a \"vulture investing\" firm that makes real vultures look good by comparison.\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources - with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune's former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can't escape the industry's economic challenges.\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry's coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company's news assets.\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn't have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government's Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\nMcClatchy's parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune's largest shareholder.\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\nThe owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board, but it's still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some shareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune's large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy's stable of smaller metro newspapers.\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong's purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune.  Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that's where the news audience has been moving to.\nGateHouse hasn't been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm's practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to \"consolidate copy editing and page design\" at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. \"GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,\" Abernathy reported.\nReed, who will be the merged company's chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and \"to return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.\" It shouldn't escape notice that it's not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with \"investing for growth.\"\nColumn: Freelancers fear California's new gig worker law will wipe them out\nFreelance writers and photographers fear California's new gig worker law will make them unemployable.\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as \"morally wrong.\"\n\"I know we're happy to get rid of Fortress,\" Cooperman told Reed. \"They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they're going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn't even take the money, given what they've done here.\" (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. \"Financial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,\" says Doctor. \"They see the way down as close to inevitable.\"\nIn the news business that's a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery - McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline - and at an ever faster pace - those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they're trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.\n\"After two more years of this,\" Doctor asks, \"what kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription? What's your strategy after all the cost-cutting?\"\n"

It's a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I'm in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn't want to spend it. He's older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I'm going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he'll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we've patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies' room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don't care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn't let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her \"sister\" didn't answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn't care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I'm 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn't. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don't think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

        "texto":"Did the War on Terror Create Trump?\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford's obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It's currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford's career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn't anyone publishing his books?\nAdvertisement\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford's uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn't spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, \"He was brilliant from the start-reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.\" He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly-after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. \"When you're reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,\" said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. \"Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he's doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. \"You're only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that's out of the water in every novel,\" she said. \"It makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it's too hard for people because he wouldn't spell things out.\" When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he'd respond, \"I have a horror of being obvious.\"\nAdvertisement\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what's going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford's characters often do. If there's one unifying theme to his books, it's a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\"Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would've been George R.R.\u00a0Martin.\" - Neil Gaiman\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The ephemera of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called \"Ask Dr. Mike\" at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World , the first book in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV .) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called \"Winter Solstice, Camelot Station,\" went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here .)\nAdvertisement\n\"He would make art in the most surprising places,\" Gaiman told me. \"Once he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.\" When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. \"Life was not long enough,\" she recalled, \"for Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\"He could have had a more successful career,\" Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa's husband and Tor's editor in chief, said, \"if he had been more disciplined about his writing\" and stuck to one genre, or written a series. \"But Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nNo single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, \"Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would've been George R.R. Martin.\" Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels ( The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet? , both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night \"should've been marketed like The Name of the Rose . You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.' \" Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin's, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn't exactly do Umberto Eco-level business.\nAdvertisement\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002. Photo by David Dyer-Bennet\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. \"All it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,\" Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. \"To be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn't.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTo the extent that Ford's health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor's willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a \"games consultant\" for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his \"blood brother,\" had essentially adopted him.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford's biological family were conservative Christians; Ford's attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble . But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford's partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. \"My partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,\" Matthesen recalled in an email. \"I used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.\"\nAdvertisement\n\"The thing with Elise bothered\" Ford's family, Starner said. \"I don't know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.\" But either way, at some point, Ford's now-deceased father told Starner that \"the only way I know he's alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as \"a magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.\" When he'd finish chunks of it, he'd fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. \"It's not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,\" he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:\nAdvertisement\nIf a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.\nIf he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\nIf he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. \"He looked a little surprised,\" she wrote in an email. \"Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.\" Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had \"married,\" but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (\"The Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,\" was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford's family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford's passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford's mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford's unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford's apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford's friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford's body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford's immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford's Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion , and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished\u00a0Aspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford's family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford's literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online ) was that Ford's family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.\nAdvertisement\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford's sister, Martha Fry. \"I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,\" she said.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAll contact between Ford's immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but\u00a0bitterness.\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was \"introverted by nature.\" \"I once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,\" Dale wrote. \"We went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. . Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.\" Martha added that shortly before their father's death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was \"kind and loving.\"\nAdvertisement\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike's relationship with Elise. \"Mike's personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,\" Dale wrote. \"I am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike's body and calling the police. . Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as 'friend,' not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.\"\nAdvertisement\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with \"the unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals . if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike's commercial affairs.\" However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike's agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn't hear back, they assumed there wasn't.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford's friends, that his agent could have ignored his family's requests?\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford's agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford's death, his agent Valerie Smith \"was beginning the process of essentially vanishing\" from the industry. She \"became more and more intermittent\" with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone.\u00a0\u00a0Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford's death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978.\u00a0Web of Angels\u00a0was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her \"pretty overwhelmed,\" she said.\u00a0Her heartbreak over Mike Ford's death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. \"When I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,\" she said. \"I just can't bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.\" Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford's work.\nAdvertisement\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford's horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family's perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBut I reconnected Ford's family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish-at long last-the unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\nAdvertisement\nAs in one of John M. Ford's novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It's not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It's not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they've carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford's work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\"I don't even have words, it's such good news,\" she replied in an email. \"Except maybe Mike's words.\"\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I'm going to die. Tell me a story.\n\"No,\" he said. \"No. You tell me one, and when you're gone, I'll tell it to somebody else.\"\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M.

Shortly after, some of Trump's defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador's net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence.\u00a0 Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune.\u00a0\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\u00a0\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates.\u00a0\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch's net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates.\u00a0\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure.\u00a0\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony.\u00a0\n"

The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\nNear-term consolidation likely\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\nThe Indian market's high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market's expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group's 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban's deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group's Haqqani network.\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages \"give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\"We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.\"\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. \"We pray for the full recovery of both men,\" said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. \"We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.\"\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week , he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\nHe also said he hoped the swap would \"pave the way\" for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, \"We are profoundly pleased and relieved\" at the hostages' release, adding that Weeks' family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release - but it's impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\nShare this article:\n"

        "texto":"White House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently \"acquired\" both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.\nBreathing tests demonstrated that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren't moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\nA CT of his chest revealed a \"ground glass\" pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\"Pigeon breeder's lung\" is a variation of hypersensitivity penumonitis. (Photo: Getty Images)\nGetty\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called \"feather duvet lung.\" When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is \"bird fancier's lung.\" When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called \"pigeon breeder's lung.\" If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn't occur often enough to have its own name.\nWait there's more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what's called \"farmer's lung,\" not to be confused with a farmer's tan. \"Humidifier lung\" may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is \"hot tub lung,\" which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn't. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it's not always good if what's in a hot tub makes you breathless.\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)\nGetty\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids \"had a transformative effect within 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.\"\nEventually, everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, \"the course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%-98% which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\"\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it's not someone whom you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it's the pigeons that you are breeding by the dozens in your kitchen.\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like \"feather duvet lung\" are still relatively uncommon. That's why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where after even the slightest touch, you feel weak.\nFollow me on\u00a0 Twitter \u00a0or\u00a0 LinkedIn .\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0 website .\u00a0\n"

        "texto":"| by Olivia Larsen\nIn July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective.\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell's Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures , a large foundation with which we work closely.\nSummary\nThis post will discuss the following:\nWhy Evidence Action Beta is promising. ( More )\nRisks we see with this Incubation Grant. ( More )\nOur plans for following Evidence Action Beta's work going forward. ( More )\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\nA key part of GiveWell's research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs . GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create . [an] incubator . focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, . our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling . promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta's parent organization, Evidence Action , leads two of our top charities ( Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season ) and one standout charity ( Dispensers for Safe Water ).\nModeling cost-effectiveness\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant's cost-effectiveness.\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\nThis could occur:\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities-in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities' funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities' funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn't direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta's incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here .)\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant : note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers , but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nRisks to the success of the grant\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell's 2017 top charities , or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities , end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\nGoing forward\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n"

A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\u00a0\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\nRelated: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\u00a0\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\u00a0\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\u00a0\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\u00a0\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports .\n"

        "texto":"TEDMED\n\"I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, 'I don't even know that I can trust this data, you know?'\" Pluznick recalled. \"Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.\"\nThis wasn't the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett , who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions.\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert's colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections .\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney's secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure . \"Other labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,\" Pluznick said.\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove\u00a0home the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to \"taste\" and \"smell\" minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host's defenses.\nA Job for Tuft Cells\nIn researchers' assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn't led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren't contributing to our sense of taste.\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. \"They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn't really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,\" said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells' function, and he eventually got his answer - through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected - specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\nHowitt realized that T. muris wasn't an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice - something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. \"We weren't looking for protozoa,\" Howitt said. \"We were focused on bacteria.\"\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn't happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\nHowitt's findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body's defenses - one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists' understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett's work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that\u00a0finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\"Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,\" he said.\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature , respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, \"people just kind of ignored them or didn't even realize that they were there,\" said Megan Baldridge , a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body's invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system's maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno , now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen's studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert's at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs' recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection, newly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears at right). Tuft cells don't normally appear in these airways, but they seem to emerge as part of the body's response against the infection.\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\"Sure enough, they were all over the place,\" Vaughan said. But the tuft cells only appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he and Herbert were \"basically seeing a cell type where [it's] not supposed to be.\" Although he's unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens after the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body's attempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune response.\nThe researchers don't yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or what they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually \"taste\" the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for the body to respond to even minute threats.\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products present in microenvironments within the body. \"Once some of those metabolic products go out of whack . bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a response if something is wrong.\"\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous systems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose tools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell. It isn't clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all evolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of \"taste\" receptors on the tongue first, \"that doesn't mean that's the order in which it evolved.\"\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors' immune functions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as monocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to detect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed that rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts suggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent receptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of other groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these receptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them for any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft cells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the invaders before they've gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the sudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not always present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\"You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,\" he said. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and asthma: There could be dangers \"if you have too many of these cells and they're too poised to respond to the external environment.\"\nCorrection added Nov. 18, 2019: The caption\u00a0below the photograph of Herbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to observe the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice.\nThis article was reprinted on\u00a0 Wired.com .\n"

Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\nInternal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\nInvestigators\u00a0focused on how Epstein had the\u00a0opportunity to hang himself\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein\u00a0hanged himself with a bedsheet, his\u00a0death was\u00a0shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\nFor months, federal authorities examined\u00a0the conduct of the staffers assigned to\u00a0Epstein's unit and how he\u00a0escaped notice.\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters' questions.\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. \"It is our hope that we'll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,\" said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\u00a0\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would \"ruin his life.\"\n\"We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney's Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,\" Figgins said.\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they're going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they're going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?\"\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died.\u00a0\"When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you'll have a different appreciation for what was going on.\"\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\nPrison union\u00a0representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and\u00a0compromised\u00a0security at the Manhattan facility.\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff\u00a0vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union.\u00a0Prison officials\u00a0regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m.\u00a0shift, the one on which\u00a0Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records.\u00a0On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr\u00a0reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and\u00a0prison officials placed Noel and Thomas\u00a0on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records,\u00a0had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\u00a0\nAfter the hearing,\u00a0Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public's trust in us.\"\nEpstein's inner circle eyed:\u00a0 Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring \u00a0 days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\u00a0\nExperts on jail suicide\u00a0told USA TODAY that an inmate can\u00a0be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate\u00a0is no\u00a0longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\"When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he\u00a0experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\u00a0\n\"Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.\"\nContributing: Kristine Phillips\nEpstein accusers: Empowering, upsetting to testify\nMore than a dozen women spoke out in a courtroom Tuesday about the sexual abuse they say they've suffered at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein.

(credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\nSeeking a bigger role for a big rocket\nby Jeff Foust\nMonday, November 18, 2019\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket's core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a \"Green Run\" test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\"If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,\" Cooke said.\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA's exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn't using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration's own party in Congress. \"Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,\" said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee's space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA's exploration plans.\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA's Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\"While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,\" he continued.\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA's approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA's current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. \"The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,\" said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke's clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\"If you don't have a big booster, you're not going to make it,\" Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\"SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,\" he continued. \"If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.\" He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit-no Gateway required.\nAt last week's hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\"The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,\" Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke's earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. \"I cannot disagree with it.\"\n\"But with eight launches, I'll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,\" he concluded.\n\"Oh my,\" Lucas responded with a sigh.\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. \"If you don't have a big booster, you're not going to make it,\" he said. \"You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don't have it, you're not going to make it.\"\nYoung, in his testimony, didn't specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called \"experiments\" in procurement. \"Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,\" he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\"A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,\" he said. \"I personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.\"\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. \"The plate is really full today,\" he said. \"I personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.\"\nOne thing Young would push off NASA's plate is the Gateway. \"I do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,\" he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. \"There's not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.\"\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. \"Adding an additional SLS into the mix could-I'm not confident that could happen.\"\nLast week's hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA's use-or unwillingness to use-the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\"I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,\" he said, including the first Block 1B. \"What do you think?\"\n\"It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,\" responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn't funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\"We haven't seen the performance yet that would indicate that we're guaranteed the second core we'd need for a Moon landing in 2024,\" added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. \"Adding an additional SLS into the mix could-I'm not confident that could happen.\"\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. \"What commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?\"\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman's OmegA.\n\"There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,\" Bridenstine added. \"We're not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.\"\n\"What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,\" Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles-or SLS.\n\"But if commercial's not available, what's the contingency plan?\" Aderholt asked again.\n\"I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,\" Bridenstine said. \"If we don't have the additional rockets, then we're not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we're confident we'll have those rockets.\"\n\"If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\" Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke's past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\"We're not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we'll assess their approaches.\"\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\"Using the lift capability of NASA's Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a 'Fewest Steps to the Moon' approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,\" Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the \"national team\" led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin's New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\nNASA's plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\"It's hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don't know the costs down the road,\" Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, \"in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\"\nBabin referred to those comments at last week's hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were \"dwindling.\"\n\"If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\" he said. \"This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.\"\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA's architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\nJeff Foust ( jeff@thespacereview.com ) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews .

They range from the truly massive - SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle - to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\u00a0\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we'll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle , which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\u00a0\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres\u00a0Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\u00a0\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\u00a0\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\u00a0\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool - to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\u00a0\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n"

In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,\" Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats' central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\"Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that 'there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\n\"With the Democrats' poll-tested 'quid-pro-quo' and 'bribery' narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,\" Grisham said.\n\"We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate 'impeachment' proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses' personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was 'accurate' and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to 'bribery' or any other crime,\" she added.\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\n\"Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,\" Grisham said.\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump's request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\n\"Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,\" Vindman said.\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\"I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,\" she said.\n\"I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,\" Williams said.\n\"I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,\" she said in response to a question.\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\"We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,\" Volker said.\n"

I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another\u00a0 HomePod , but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren't always the right gift.\nThat's why I'm approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products , and most of those picks are still applicable.\nBut there's also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I've received for testing - new technology that I'm super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I'm grateful for this year.\nSatechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it's totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit\u00a0while charging in the car.\nSatechi's awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I've tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro - even during use.\nIt's amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I'm still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports , but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\nIt's not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year - not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\nThanks to new GaN ( gallium nitride ) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\nRAVPower's 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I've bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it's black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple's chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable , available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nWhile no one has matched Apple's vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\nMophie's recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It's not cheap at $140, but it's very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\nPrior to Mophie's solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad's version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie's personally. If you don't need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat \u00a0with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\nEven with Apple's AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods , Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn't expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200\u00a0before\u00a0you factor the cost of a new TV.\nI've been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year.\u00a0Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we're sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\nIf you're considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\nI've been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop\u00a0Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack .\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn't want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse . I received one for testing alongside the $99\u00a0 Logitech's MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple's mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple's standalone Magic Keyboard.\nThen there's reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro\u00a0and\u00a0my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I'm using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it's not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age - even after a keyboard repair.\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio . iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven't seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\nIt may not be\u00a0for me, but it's absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\nPublished November 18, 2019.

        "texto":"by Jeff Foust -\nNovember 18, 2019\nSpaceX said its Starship lunar lander will be able to transport 100 metric tons to the surface of the moon, far more than NASA's requirements under the CLPS program. Credit: SpaceX\nWASHINGTON - NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\nNASA said the five companies - Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems - had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\nThis \"on-ramp\" to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission , a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n\"We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,\" Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n\"We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,\" said Shotwell, referring to NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX's commercial cargo capability.\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a \"nice stepping stone\" to later crewed missions. She didn't give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship \"a lot\" before flying any missions with people on board.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May , capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. \"It has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,\" said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. \"Our company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,\" said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company's CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA's broader plans. \"Space exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,\" he said. \"Small player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.\" He said his company's lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company's chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. \"We're going to start with something smaller,\" he said. \"Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.\"  He declined to say when his company's lander would be ready.\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago : Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later , citing internal business issues.\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released \"sometime soon\" for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two \"deliveries\" of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n"

Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been expected to sign a partial trade deal for about a month, but those negotiations hit another snag last week.\nThe US government on Monday did extend a temporary general license allowing American companies to sell to Huawei, the embattled Chinese tech company that has become a symbol of tensions between the two countries. It's the third 90-day extension of the license, which is now set to expire in February.\nSearch\n"

        "texto":"Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\nSweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:50 GMT\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (AFP)\nHighlights\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden's attorney general.\nSweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.\n\"After conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the course of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,\" Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on Tuesday.\nPersson explained that the complainant's evidence had initially been deemed credible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made clear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened, primarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses' memories had faded for natural reasons.\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden's attorney general.\nAssange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\nFollowing Assange's arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n"

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\nAccording to The Verge's Stadia review , the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K.

So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn't the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised - it's revealed in Eurogamer's Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn't terrible. If you're not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles, \u00a0it's not a bad alternative.

        "texto":"Evidence Based\n15 Helpful Tips to Overcome Binge Eating\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD - Medically reviewed by Timothy J. Legg, Ph.D., CRNP - Updated on November 14, 2019\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating disorder in the United States (\n1\n).\nBED is about more than food, it's a recognized psychological condition. That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they're not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame.\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try - both at home and with the help of a professional - to reduce episodes of binge eating.\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\nShare on Pinterest\n1. Ditch the diet\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (\n2\n).\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (\n3\n).\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes .\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains , and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.\nSummary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.\n2. Avoid skipping meals\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (\n4\n).\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (\n).\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\nSummary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.\n3. Practice mindfulness\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (\n).\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (\n7\n).\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\nSummary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you're no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.\n4. Stay hydrated\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (\n8\n).\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13-17 ounces (375-500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (\n"

        "texto":"Ilana Muhlstein, MS, RDN\nIf you're like me and you don't follow football throughout the season, you can always find something to love about game day - whether it's rooting for the underdog, enjoying the halftime show and commercials, or just having a good time with friends and family.\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss program\u00a0 2B Mindset ,\u00a0I want to help you enjoy everything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\nFootball food is \" comfort food \" - pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs - and they can be very hard to resist.\nBut it's important to remember that we're fueling our bodies to watch football, not actually play it!\n5 Tips to Enjoy Game Day Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-Loss Goals:\n1. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\nI know - it all looks so good. But you can't eat it all, so it's time to set priorities.\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks - those that are vegetable-based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you're less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\nAnd you don't have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can't live without and leave it at that.\n2. Don't forget to drink water\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you're drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they're there.\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we're feeling especially hungry.\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\nThat's especially true when you're watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there - and without realizing it, you've consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying your food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you're eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don't overdo it.\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don't let your fingers do the walking.\n4. \"Veggie-fy\" your chips 'n' dip\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip.\nBut instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a vegetable instead.\nBecause let's be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it's the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips .\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you'll see that you'll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\nAnd don't forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip - those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\nHealthy Game Day Dip:\u00a0Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories.\nEnjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you'll get plenty of tangy crunch - without all the calories.\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you're saving nearly 100 calories - about the same as a bottle of light beer.\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats?\nThis is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself \"no.\" That's why I always tell my clients: \"An open face is a happy face!\"\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you're out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks - without overdoing it!\n\u00a0\n"

        "texto":"Kamala Harris to be first woman to have US presidential powers\n(CNN)\nPresident Donald Trump, according to the White House , made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a \"quick exam and labs\" as the first stage of his annual physical.\nYou shouldn't just believe them.\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic .)\nRead More\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\nSearch\n"

Anthony Gonzalez told CNN's Jake Tapper something over the weekend that crystallized a question I keep coming back to when it comes to the Republican party's continuing loyalty to former President Donald Trump.\n\"The cold hard truth is Donald Trump led us into a ditch on January 6,\" Gonzalez, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his conduct on January 6, told Tapper . \"The former President lied to us. He lied to every one of us and in doing so he cost (Republicans) the House, the Senate and the White House.\"\nYes! This!\nPolitics has always been a bit of a rough game. Politicians who win -- and help others win -- are lauded. Those who don't, well, aren't. It's transactional.\nThat reality is why I assumed that following Trump's 2020 loss, there would be a significant reckoning within the party about the last four years -- and a turning away from Trump.\nRead More\nAfter all, that he oversaw -- and contributed to -- Republican losses is indisputable.\nIn 2018, Republicans lost 40 House seats  -- and the House majority -- in an election that Democrats successfully turned into a referendum on Trump. (That Trump's approval ratings was stuck in the low 40s in the run-up to that election effectively sealed Republicans' fate.)\nTwo years later, Trump not only lost the presidency convincingly but also likely cost Republicans their Senate majority by spending the months after the election talking almost exclusively about (his lie of) how he was cheated out of victory. Democrats won two runoffs in Georgia while Trump was distracting the party base and, in so doing, recaptured the Senate majority.\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\nSo, Trump came into office in 2016 with Republicans in the majority in the House and Senate. He left office in 2020 with Republicans totally out of power in the executive and legislative branches.\nThat record of losses should -- if history was any guide -- leave such a stench of defeat around Trump that no one in the party would want to be around him much less have him as their de facto leader.\nAnd yet, here we are.\nWhat gives?\nThe most obvious explanation for how Trump has managed to win despite losing is that he, well, never admits that he has lost.\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Trump tweeted that he had \"received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night.\" Later he tweeted that \"those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well.\"\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 loss, Trump has spent months propagating the lie that there was widespread voter fraud that cost him a win. (Note: There wasn't.)\nTrump's willingness to say up is down -- and for large parts of the Republican base to take his word for it -- appears to have created an ahistoric moment for the Republican party: They are following a man who oversaw widespread setbacks for the party over the last four years. And more than that: They want him to run for president again in 2024!\nSearch\n"

And don't forget to make a backup plan.\nVisit Business Insider's Investing Reference library for more stories .\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there . In general, here are the steps you can take:\nHow to retire early\n1. Define early retirement\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again - unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live - i.e. financial independence - but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for - but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n2. Take inventory\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the\u00a0 Physician on FIRE , retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances .\u00a0\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should\u00a0 calculate your net worth . This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your\u00a0 annual spending . You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3. Establish your target number\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\u00a0\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \" Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need ,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner\u00a0can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal - and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n4. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE . LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American.\u00a0By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n5. Leverage your income\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income , he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort - it's a short-term solution - whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income , such as real estate , he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA , which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions - not including any earnings - tax-free, at any time.\n7. Invest the money that's left over\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds . Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it , while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\nTommy - who only goes by his first name online - retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post . One of his biggest regrets ? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n9. Research your options for health insurance\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance - if available to you - is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA ; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n10. Make a backup plan\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement - would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank , taking your net worth with it - would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\u00a0\n11. Put Plan A into action - but enjoy the present, too\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire , \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\nRelated coverage in Investing :\n"
