(Manu Fernandez/AP)\n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nMADRID — Rafael Nadal kept Spain’s hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and\nFeliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give\nthe hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\n\nGranollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5)\nto seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m.\nlocal time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nThe top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the\nseries 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3,\n7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\n\"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win,\notherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a\ngood position to advance.\"\n\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight\nhours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court.\nSpain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia.\nRussia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two\nsingles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the\nknockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six\ngroups.\n\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a\nposition that you don’t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match,\nwe were under pressure.\"\n\nSerbia’s Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Andy Murray will make their first\nappearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the\nNetherlands.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams\nplaying in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year\npartnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group\nco-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also\nincluded a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd\nthroughout the matches.\n\nUS FALLS\n\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after\nVasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov\ndefeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well,\nserved well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American\nneighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\nFRANCE WINS\n\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo\nPierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of\nJapan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-\nranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but\ncapitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis\nCup runner-up.\n\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1\nand Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals,\nwhere they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New\nZealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of\nconfidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win\nbut we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\nARGENTINA CRUISES\n\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating\nNicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2,\n6-2.\n\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped\nJarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n\"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for\nsure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I\nthink Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played\nunreal tennis.\"\n\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and\nclinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated\nRobin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van\nde Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro\nGonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\n\nEpic singles wins give Canada best Davis Cup Finals start imaginable\n\nRyan McKenna\n\nShapovalov, Pospisil give Canada a pair of upsets over Italy at Davis Cup\n\nCanadian Press\n\n%2Ftennis%2Fargentina-comfortably-wins-davis-cup-opener-chile%2F\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid\nposting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure\nof American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to\ninfluence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants\nsabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of\nthe humanitarian convoy’s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened\nfamilies wishing to leave the camp.”\n\nSource: Russian Defense Ministry, October 25, 2019\n\nFalse\n\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\n\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense\nministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria’s al-Tanf of controlling\n“bandit formations” and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in\nthe Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian\ngovernment.\n\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as “patently false,” and both\nindependent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the\nRussian and Syrian claims are false.\n\n**The al-Tanf base**\n\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave\nSyria under President Donald Trump’s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S.\nmilitary personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East\nobservers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq\nand Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer “de-confliction zone” on the\nBaghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as\nan outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in\norder to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces.\nThe U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation\ncampaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\n#### **The Rukban camp**\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria’s\nborder with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the\ncountry’s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross\nover to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted\nmore than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan’s economy and\ninfrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban\ncrossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at\naround 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian\ndisaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to\nforce the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n####  **“U.S.-controlled bandit formations”**\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian\nopposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT – formerly the Free\nSyrian Army – to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based\ngeopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018\nthat MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the\nforefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that\nthe U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as\n\"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at\nTufts University’s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the\nRussian Defense Ministry’s allegations are false.\n\n“I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not ‘control’ any\nactors there directly,” Simpson said. “From my interviews, it appears all U.S.\ninterventions in the region are indirect and sparse.”\n\n**“… prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp”**\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban\ncamp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be\nidentified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim is\n“absolutely not true.”\n\n“Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing\ncivilians from leaving the camp,” the source said. “Many people are afraid to\nreturn to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They\nwant a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.”\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military\noperation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon\ncorrespondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense\nministry’s claim “is patently false,” and that “the United States is not\npreventing people from leaving Rukban.”\n\n“Rukban is another example of the Assad regime’s consistent practice, with\nRussian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using\nthe situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane\nbehavior,” Robertson said.\n\nHe added: “The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of\nstarvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are\nblocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take\nresponsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must\ncontinue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.”\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is\n“working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said\nthey need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary\nguarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure\nU.N. access to the shelters in Homs.”\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to\nleave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n“Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into\nJordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border\nsecurity operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to\ncivilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the\nregion,” Simpson said. “This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban,\nrather than returning to say, Palmyra.”\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: “The United States does not support\nforced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they\nare hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and\ndignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.”\n\n##  Most popular\n\n  * ###  Most Viewed \n\n    * 1\n\n####  Phone Intercepts Suggest Russian Control Over Ukraine Separatists Ahead\nof Malaysia Airline Shootdown\n\n    * 2\n\n####  Russia and Syria: U.S.-backed Syrian Forces Blocking Refugee Return\n\n    * 3\n\n####  Transnistrian TV Spins Russian Expert’s Statement On Independence\n\n    * 4\n\n####  Hey Daily Mail: It’s 'Ki-yeev,' Not ‘KEEV’\n\n    * 5\n\n####  Russian Official: Extradition of Russian Hacker to U.S. Illegal -- False\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Follow Us \n\n    *     *     *     *   * Info \n\n    * About this project\n    * Terms of Use\n    * Contact Us\n    * Newsletter\n    * Vacancies\n\n© 2019 POLYGRAPH.info All Rights Reserved.\n\nXS\n\nSM\n\nMD\n\nLG\n\n"

The denials were in spite\nof the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City\nmansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for\nsex parties.\n\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is,\nthe general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and\ndisgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but “an articulated\nlorry crash” performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent\nmedia suspicions of culpability in Epstein’s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has\nleft himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and\nevasions.\n\n> “Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his\n> position as a member of the royal family,” said one legal expert, as\n> reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\n> “His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under\n> investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,” the expert\n> warned.\n\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and\ncontradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of\nalleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein’s “unbecoming” behavior (classic\naloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an\nalibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18\nyears ago – on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a\nhouse in London belonging to Epstein’s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A\nphoto of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited\nEpstein in New York in 2010 – after Epstein was released from prison for\ntrafficking a minor for prostitution – in order to terminate his friendship.\n\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in\nperson that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of\nfriendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein’s orgy\nmansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with\nEpstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how\nvulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\n> He instead told the BBC interviewer: “I took the judgement call that because\n> this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over\n> the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and\n> talk to him.”\n\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The\nrectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all\nthis purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein\ncontradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were “not close”.\n\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations\npunctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew’s otherwise “lack of remorse”\nor “sympathy” with the victims of Epstein’s sex abuse empire, as expressed in\nthe BBC interview.\n\nLawyers for Epstein’s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview\ngiven by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by\nprosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-\nindictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for\nquestioning.\n\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice\nfrom several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated\nmedia fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen\nElizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work,\npublicly-funded royals are.\n\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands\nWar (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience\nallegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body\nsweating.\n\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let’s see if he\ncan keep his royal pants dry this time.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect\nthose of Sputnik.\n\n...\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle+\n\nBlogger\n\nPinterest\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n553\n\nTrackDo not trackCommunity standardsDiscussion\n\nComment via FacebookComment via Sputnik\n\n  *  __Сomment\n  *  __Add Comment\n\nThank you!

Later that evening, he admitted that he took\nthe child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her\ninto a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's\nroom. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and\nhiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers,\nhaving visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\n####  Trending News\n\n  * Video shows dramatic rescue of kidnapped girl: \"We got her!\" \n  * Man arrested after 7 trafficking victims found in car: Police \n  * Jeffrey Epstein jail guards charged with falsifying records \n  * White teen accused of plotting deadly attack on black church \n  * Safety officials urge Boeing to redesign part on 737s \n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort\nWorth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family\nfriend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police\nDepartment responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the\nfront passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into\nthe hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry\nbasket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and\nWebb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in\ncustody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth\ndeliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping\nthe girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she\nand her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on\nSaturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother\nknocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and\nsmart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical\nfight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for\nand agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope\nis that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he\nwill never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney\nNealy Cox.\n\nFirst published on November 19, 2019 / 8:16 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

How\nthe diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from\nthe fiery chaos of _the Big Bang_ remains one of the most difficult unsolved\npuzzles of _cosmology_.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most\ndetailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call\nTNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains\ntens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen\nonly in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion\nparticles representing _dark matter_, gases, stars and supermassive black\nholes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key\ninsights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped\ngalaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black\nholes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two\narticles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal _Monthly\nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society_.\n\n**Related:** _ **From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through\nTime**_\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the _IllustrisTNG Project_, which\naims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big\nBang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details\nof individual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting\nand understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said\nPaul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and\nco-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're\ngetting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies\nthat give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems\nlooks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required\n16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen _supercomputer_ in Stuttgart, Germany,\nrunning continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a\nsingle processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most\ncomputationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers\nbelieve their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get\nout more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max\nPlanck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the\nstudy, _said in a statement_. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had\nnot been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena\nemerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical\ningredients of our model universe.\"\n\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures\n(in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel\ncosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG\nCollaboration)\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe\nappears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed\nresearchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent\nclouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered\nthat the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally\nemerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including\nspiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive _black\nholes_. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life\nobservations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively\nconsistent with reality.\n\n **Related:** _ **The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe**_\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks,\nanother phenomenon began to emerge. _Supernova_ explosions and supermassive\nblack holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas.\nThese outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years\nabove a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back\nunto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a\nfeedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients\nfor forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's\nstructure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into\nthin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their\nmodel. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for\nastronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations\ncompleted,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better\nunderstand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent\ntrends show up in that data.\"\n\n  *  _15 Amazing Images of Stars_\n  *  _11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way Galaxy_\n  *  _The 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark Matter_\n\n _Originally published on_ _Live Science_ _._\n\n_Need more space?_ _Subscribe to our sister title \"All About Space\" Magazine_\n_for the latest amazing news from the final frontier!_ (Image credit: All\nAbout Space)\n\n###  __Sign Up for e-mail newsletters\n\nGet breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky\nparticles and more!\n\nNo spam, we promise.

Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro\nelectric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range.\nUS range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of\nthe original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet\nwide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive\nside profile.\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts\nin light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the\nindividual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi\nsays, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road\n– such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED\nclusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a\nnew Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch\ntrims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody\nprotection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be\nfinished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging\nflap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air\nsuspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper,\nand larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there\nare body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A\nblack styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and\nbumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the\nstandard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag.\nHowever US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal\nregulations.\n\n## Power and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the\ne-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery\ncapacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That\npromises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6\nseconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps\non the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of\ntorque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7\nseconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic\nbrakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with\nseven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can\nlower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its\nheight by a total of 3-inches.\n\n## Range and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the\ne-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though,\nthat those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more\ngenerous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual\nside mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that\nthe Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty\nminutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22\nkW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge\n– which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by\nplugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\n## Interior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom\nversus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re\nlooking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to\n58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi\nvirtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system.\nThere’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with\noptional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option,\nas will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone\nbox which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper\ntouchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the\n8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is\noptional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing,\nwhile navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon\nAlexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning,\nremote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a\nnew “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and\ninfotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent\nbasis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi\nassist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic\nassistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise,\nturn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park\nassist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi\nfits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve\nultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick\nthings off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch\nedition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro\n($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron\nSportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next\nyear.\n\n## Story Timeline\n\n  * Audi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n  * 2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve\n\n###### __2020 Audi e-tron Sportback Gallery\n\n  \n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Reddit\n  * \n\nTopics AudiEVLA Auto Show 2019luxury\n\nMust Read Bits & Bytes\n\n  * ## Google Play Store needs more than AI to make app recommendations useful\n\n  * ## 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\n\n  * ## Pokemon Sword and Shield first impressions: My kingdom for a Bulbasaur\n\n  * ## Pokemon GO creators’ next big game: CATAN World Explorers\n\n  * ## Sony bets on artificial intelligence with new Sony AI global division\n\n### Site Information\n\nAbout / Advertise / Tip Us / Contact\n\n### Policies\n\nEditorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use  \n© 2005-2019 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.\n\n### Social and Media\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\n"

He didn’t get it.Credit...Doug\nMills/The New York Times\n\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major,\nstatewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature;\nin Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the\ngovernor’s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n“Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!”\nTrump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total\nEndorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT\nGovernor, @MattBevin!”\n\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with\nall of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with\neverything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.\n\n“The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally\nin Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up and they’re going\ndown.”\n\n“You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”\n\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead,\nthey did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the\nfirst time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky\nDemocrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in\n2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state\nTrump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points.\nDemocrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of\nvictory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half\npoints, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant\nwon in a landslide.\n\nIt’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races\nwere centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and\neducation. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where\nhealth care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy\nBeshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act\nin the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for\nwork requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the\nMedicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000\nstate residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well,\nwhere an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the\nexpansion.\n\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn’t mean it wasn’t in the air.\nVoters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They\ncould have elevated the president’s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an\nunambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president’s\nimmediate political fortunes.\n\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows\nmajority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that\n“President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House\nand removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70 percent of\nAmericans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine\ninto investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters\npoll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the\nHouse to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most\nAmericans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable\noffenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”\n\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have\nlimited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these\nnumbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right\nto take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the\ntable — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that\ntackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s\nphone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not\njust the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a\nclassified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and\nSaudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s\nrefusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from\nthose of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior\nacross a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats\ncouldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to\nlet it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate,\nremember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\nI don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch\nMcConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president.\nYes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is\nany prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage\nover the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance,\nespecially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would\nalso allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to\ncampaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a\ntrial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full\ntruth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making\nAmerica great again.\n\n _The Times is committed to publishing_ _a diversity of letters_ _to the\neditor.

The news and stories that\nmatter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nNov. 20, 2019, 9:28 AM UTC\n\nBy Reuters\n\nVIENNA — The house where Adolf Hitler was born will be turned into a police\nstation, Austria's interior minister said on Tuesday, after years of debate\nover how best to prevent it becoming a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis.\n\nHaving recently carried out a compulsory purchase of the house in Braunau am\nInn, a town on the border with Germany, Austria will invite architects to\nsubmit plans for a redesign of the building. It will house the local police\nforce's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that\nthis building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\"\nInterior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of\ncivil servants, said in the statement.\n\nArchitects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for\nthe building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials\nwill pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior\nMinistry said.\n\nAlthough Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that\nit was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's\nGermany in 1938.\n\nRecent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also\nperpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's\nrule.\n\nReuters\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * NBCNews.COM Site Map\n  * Advertise\n  * AdChoices\n\n© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\n  *   *   * \n\n"

(Paul Chiasson/CP)\n\nPete Borkowski |  @PeteB_93 November 11, 2019, 11:28 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nPete Borkowski @PeteB_93 November 11, 2019, 11:28 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nMilos Raonic has withdrawn from next week’s Davis Cup Finals in Madrid with a\nback injury.\n\nTennis Canada released a statement on Monday morning announcing that the world\nNo. 31 will be unable to participate in first edition of the revamped\ninternational team competition.\n\nRaonic has struggled all season with the back injury, only playing five\nmatches since the Rogers Cup in August, where he retired from his second-round\nmatch against countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime because of it. The injury also\nforced him to miss both the French Open and U.S. Open in 2019.\n\n“It is very hard and disappointing for me that I will not be able to represent\nmy country at Davis Cup,\" Raonic said in the statement. \"My health has\ncontinued to let me down through this entire year and now once again. I will\ntake the appropriate time to get healthy and I look forward to being back on\ncourt next season.”\n\n\"I believe in my teammates, and I know they’ll give everything to secure\nCanada’s first Davis Cup title. I’ll be following them very closely and I wish\nthem the best.”\n\nRaonic has only appeared for Canada in Davis Cup play since 2015 once, that\nbeing the 2018 World Group playoffs.\n\nWorld No. 94 Brayden Schnur of Toronto will take Raonic’s place on the four-\nman team which includes world No. 15 Denis Shapovalov, No. 21 Auger-Aliassime,\nand No. 149 Vasek Pospisil.\n\n“I’m very happy to be able to play in the Davis Cup Finals but, of course, I\nfirst want to wish Milos a speedy recovery,” said Schnur in the Tennis Canada\nstatement. “It’s an honour for me to represent Canada in this team\ncompetition. We know every win will be hard-won but I’m ready to support my\nteammates and go all the way.”\n\nSchnur reached his first ATP Tour final as a qualifier in February at the New\nYork Open, losing in a third set tiebreak to Reilly Opelka. He also reached\nthree ATP Challenger Tour finals in 2019, most recently falling to his new\nDavis Cup teammate Pospisil in Charlottesville two weeks ago.\n\nIt will be the Toronto-native’s second appearance for Canada at the Davis Cup.\nHe lost both his singles matches in the 2017 World Group Playoffs against\nIndia, although Canada won the tie.\n\nAuger-Aliassime and Pospisil have also suffered injuries in the last month,\nbut both are still expected to play next week.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals will take place from Nov. 18 to 24 at the Caja Magica in\nMadrid, Spain. Canada is in a group with the United States and Italy in the 18\nteam tournament.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\n\nNadal, Djokovic playing for year-end No. 1 ranking in ATP Finals\n\nPete Borkowski\n\nDenis Shapovalov seeing results from footwork adjustment\n\nCanadian Press\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid\nposting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

It is up to them to\nde-escalate, as others should tell them\n\nMon 18 Nov 2019 18.54 GMT Last modified on Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.56 GMT\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share via Email\n\n‘Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these\nprotests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far\nbroader movement.’ Photograph: AFP via Getty\n\nHong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On\nMonday, the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that\nthere is “absolutely no room for compromise”. But it is not merely that\nBeijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue\nto escalate the crisis.\n\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nwas besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters\nattempting to flee the scene. The message – no way out – was all the more\ndisturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if\npetrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds\ntrapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a\nbishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were\nprevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong’s legislative\ncouncil was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents\nlaunched “save the students” marches converging upon the campus, they too\nfaced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol\nbombs.\n\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these\nprotests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far\nbroader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they\nshould support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late.\nMeanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for\nchallenging authorities.\n\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded\nwith unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and\nwere rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a\nprotester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between\nprotesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames\nthose in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause:\ndefending Hong Kong’s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but\ndramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People’s\nLiberation Army took to the city’s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a\n“voluntary clean-up activity” which acted as a reminder that the Chinese\nmilitary could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise\ntheir presence.\n\nThe movement’s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the\nmainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in\nXinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled,\nthe mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities\noriginated in directives from Xi to “show absolutely no mercy” in the\n“struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. Many in Hong Kong\nfear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further\nrepression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even\ninsurgency, that some have called the “Belfastisation” of the city.\n\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing’s chagrin, the prospects of\nTaiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive\nparty, as she faces next year’s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and\nDemocracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose\neconomic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human\nrights abuses.\n\nChina’s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since\n1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square,\nand witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has\ncalculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible – but not by\noffering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that\nfrom Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that\nthey are watching.\n\nTopics\n\n  * Hong Kong \n  * Opinion \n\n  * Protest \n  * Asia Pacific \n  * Communism \n  * Xi Jinping \n  * China \n  * editorials \n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share via Email\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Pinterest\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share on Messenger\n\n  * Reuse this content\n\n##  Most popular\n\n  * The Guardian view \n  * Columnists \n  * Cartoons \n  * Opinion videos \n  * Letters \n\n  * News \n  * Opinion \n  * Sport \n  * Culture \n  * Lifestyle \n\n  * Contact us \n  * Complaints & corrections \n  * SecureDrop \n  * Work for us \n  * Privacy policy \n  * Cookie policy \n  * Terms & conditions \n  * Help \n\n  * All topics \n  * All writers \n  * Digital newspaper archive \n  * Facebook \n  * Twitter \n\n  * Advertise with us \n  * Search UK jobs \n  * Dating \n  * Discount Codes \n\nSupport The Guardian\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\nContribute  Subscribe\n\nBack to top\n\n© 2019 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sonos Move. Galaxy Note 10. See what else made our list for best\ntech gadgets of the past year.\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nBy Jason Cipriani | November 18, 2019 -- 19:14 GMT (19:14 GMT) | Topic:\nHardware\n\n(Image: gargantiopa / Getty Images)\n\n###  Black Friday\n\nBusiness Bargain Hunter's top picks\n\nThe very best Black Friday deals and sales.\n\nRead More\n\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we\nsaw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple\nimpresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech\ncompanies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\n\n**Also:**See Black Friday coverage at CNET\n\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along\nwith the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to\nkeep on an eye out for the best deals.\n\n## **Some of 2019's best tech gadgets**\n\n **Disclosure** : _ZDNet_ may earn a commission from some of the products\nfeatured on this page.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro for $235\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been\nasking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple\nfinally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new\ndesign sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments,\nand comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\nNintendo\n\n### Nintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into\na dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The\nscreen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently\nattached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch\nthat users love and embrace.\n\nSonos\n\n### Sonos Move for $400\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment\nspeakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable.\nWith Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest\nof its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or\nApple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close\nthe nearest power outlet is.\n\nAmazon\n\n### Amazon Echo Buds for $130\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have\nbeen well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds\nhave Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and\nAndroid devices.\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nApple, Inc.\n\n### Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Apple**\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what\nit did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an\namazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that\nbattery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get\nthis year.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n### Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Samsung**\n\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed,\nhas a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep\nup with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your\ncreativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\n\nDJI\n\n### DJI Mavic Mini for $399\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package.\nWith a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to\nbelieve it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and\nenthusiasts who love shiny new things.\n\nFossil\n\n### Fossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Fossil**\n\nThe Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a\nnormal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient\ndisplay that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your\nconnected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\n\nWyze\n\n### Wyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Wyze**\n\nKnow when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway\nwith the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to\nconnect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\n\nAmazon\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nOne of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The\nnew Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to\nthe side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control\nconnected devices, ask questions or play music.\n\nRing\n\n### Ring Indoor Cam for $60\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nRing security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been\nmade primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and\ncapable of helping you monitor your home.\n\nLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into\na shortlist is hard. Really hard. Surely, we left some of your favorite\ngadgets off of this list. Leave a comment and let us know what your favorite\ngadget of 2019 is.\n\nBest gifts for co-workers under $50 on A...

He also agreed to return the\ncash he received from the use of “We.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology\ninvestment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch.\nSoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to\nfund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for\nsome of Neumann’s shares.\n\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later\nthis week in areas that do not support WeWork’s core business goals, said The\nWe Company’s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to\nstaff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe _New York Times_ reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000\njobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others\nwho work for affiliates.\n\nNext steps to shape the company’s future will be divulged in an all-company\nmeeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization\nto grow. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and\nresponsibilities,” added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would\nbe cut, along with jobs in WeWork’s venture capital arm and in so-called\ngrowth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction\nunits.\n\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The\ncompany rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete\nagreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as\nit sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\n\nWeWork’s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on\nMonday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n\n( _Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with\nreporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell._ )\n\n## Most Read\n\n  * Brookings: AI will heavily affect tech and white-collar jobs \n  * Hearthstone: Battlegrounds gets four new heroes in big update \n  * Why 'The Mandalorian' cites Fortnite dev Epic Games in its credits \n  * Qualcomm: 5G will cover major metros in 2020, developing countries in 2021 \n  * Clumio raises $135 million for cloud data backup and recovery tools \n\n##  UPCOMING EVENTS\n\n  * GamesBeat Summit Apr. 28-29\n  * Transform Jul. 15-16\n\n"

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\n\nChris Davies \\- Nov 19, 2019, 10:31 pm CST\n\n0\n\nVolkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t\nexpected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up\nnew potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the\nmodular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the\nmost striking yet.\n\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a\nwell-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID.\nSPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential\nproduction version for North America and Europe.\n\nThe MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker\nwith the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show\nthis week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW\nAtlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower.\n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh\nlithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give\nthe ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic\ndamping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to\nthe front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and\n517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph\ncould arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited\n109 mph.\n\nAs for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP\ncycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on\nthe EPA cycle.\n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever\nairflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being\nguided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of\nthe car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing\nwind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up;\ntouch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical\nlighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined\nby an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime\nrunning lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing\nthem flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption.\nThe roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear.\nThat’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip\ncrossing the white VW logo.\n\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the\nID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes\nheadlamps that look like they’re eyes opening.\n\nInside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench\ninstead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s\nAppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice\nproduction. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done\naway with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker\nsays it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of\nthe material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the\ndriver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment,\nand other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can\nbe assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out\ncenter console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk\nhas two electric longboards underneath.\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch\npanels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery\nmode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation\nand other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively\nchange to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural\nlanguage voice control is supported, too.\n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a\nluxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes\nto put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market\nsometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the\nability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost\neffective.\n\n## Story Timeline\n\n  * 2020 VW ID.3 official as Volkswagen bets on electric\n  * As VW ID.3 production begins, Volkswagen bets it all on an electric future\n\n###### __VW ID.

His sentencing is\nscheduled for Feb. 14, according to the office release.\n\nU.S. Attorney James Kennedy Jr. said in the release this case demonstrates\nthat free speech does not protect people to “make threats to harm lawmakers\nsimply because they may disagree with them.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSonya A. Zoghlin, Carlineo’s attorney, told The Hill in a statement that her\nclient did not intend to cause harm to Omar and did not make plans to do so.\n\n“Pat Carlineo is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to\nexpress them,” she said in an email. “He has taken responsibility for using\nthreatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this\ninstance.”\n\nCarlineo was arrested in April for a March 21 phone call he reportedly made to\nOmar’s office, in which he said he’d put a “bullet in her f---ing skull.”\n\nThe office referred the call to U.S. Capitol Police, who worked with the FBI\nto investigate.

My\nfears have been realized.\"\n\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the\nillegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day\nthat the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings\ninstead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\"\nmutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n### 2\\. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\nVolker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine\nto investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening\nstatement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have\nprovided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not\non the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I\nwas not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by\nPresident Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September\n25, 2019.\"\n\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation\ninto Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate\nUkrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he\nheard the July 25 call.\n\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not\ncredible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into\nBurisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how\nUkrainian officials could be confused.\n\n### 3\\. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\nVolker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at\n\"three amigos\" references\n\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been\nportrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was\nnot some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were\nknown as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe\nwhen I hear it.\"\n\n### 4\\. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC\nabout Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his\npredecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the\nquestion was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had\nraised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect\nVindman denied earlier in the day.\n\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about\nconcerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal\ncounsel.\n\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've\nexpected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his\ntestimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National\nSecurity Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the\nNSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion\nfrom some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n### 5\\. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\nVolker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it\non July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever\nknew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the\ndelay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of\nAugust, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold\nreleased, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was\nan internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said.\n\"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that\nsame time.\"\n\n### 6\\. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\nTim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\n\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from\nSondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in\nforming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n### 7\\. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer,\nRudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the\nnew Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call\nmade him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to\ninvestigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\nFirst published on November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to\nleave for other jobs.\n\n“We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They\nstart in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand\nteachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct\nmoney from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n“The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the\ncrowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers\nunions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of\ntheir 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than\n15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least\n5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency\ndidn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have\navoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings.\nThey seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt\nBevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers\nwho used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take\naction on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and\nArizona.\n\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway,\nIndiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state\nbudget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by\n2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted\nthe plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test\nscores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new\nILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the\nteachers unions.\n\n“We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned\nabout issues.”\n\nTeachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he\nwas keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of\nthe Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward\nHolcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in\nFebruary to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was\nneeded to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states.\nRepublican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study\nshowing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since\n2002.\n\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the\nstate’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they\nweren’t “asking for the moon.”\n\n“What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said\npoliticians have “vilified” educators.\n\n“They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t\ntrust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when\nwe’re in the classroom.”\n\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper\n\n"

Of the total participants who filled\nin The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half\nwere female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9\npercent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or\nethnicity.\n\nThe team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by\n2016—Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon— and noted if and how often\nrespondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis\nuse disorder before and after the laws were enacted.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * Dangers of Vaping: Facts and Statistics on Health Risks of E-Cigarettes\n  * Cannabis Could Ease Symptoms of Depression in PTSD Patients\n  * These Are the Industries Where Staff Are Most Likely to Smoke Weed\n\nCannabis use disorder is where a person's use of the drug negatively affects\ntheir life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use\nso much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and\nspend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\n\nIn adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the\npast month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use\nisn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent\nto 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\n\nThe number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use\ndisorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group\nin other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\n\nBut among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis\nuse in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\n\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the\nrelationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug.  Getty\n\nMarijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause\nsubstantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to\nphysical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment,\ndecline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.\n\nSenior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at\nColumbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use\ndisorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic\nand social consequences.\n\nNeil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\n\nRead more __\n\n\"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts\nshould coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be\ninformed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make\ninformed decisions,\" Martins said.\n\nIan Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of\nHealth Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the\nstudy, told _Newsweek_ : \"Although the researchers found that regular use\nincreased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate\nto a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis. Even\na small percentage increase in regular cannabis users can increase the risk of\ndeveloping problems like cannabis dependence which services would be unlikely\nto have the capacity to support.\"\n\n _This graphic, provided byStatista, shows the U.S. states where recreational\nmarijuana has been legalized. _\n\nU.S. states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational and/or medical\nuse. Statista\n\nHowever, he pointed out it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from\nobservational studies such as this one. The researchers weren't, for instance,\nable to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used,\n\"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently\nwhich wouldn't create the same degree of risk as those using high potency\ncannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.\n\nHamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers\nand manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health\nbenefits, and even basic information on strength.\n\n\"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely\nrisk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at\nrisk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time\nit is often too late,\" Hamilton said.\n\nBut he said the results also don't mean cannabis shouldn't be legalized,\nrather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support\nservices need to be adequately funded and available, something other states\nand countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis\npolicies.\"\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing, Submit Correction or view Editorial Guidelines\n\nCannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal | Health\n\nSign up for our Newsletter\n\nSign up  \nUpdate your preferences »\n\nChoose a Membership That's Perfect for You!\n\n### Print & Digital\n\nWeekly magazine, delivered  \nDaily Newsletter  \nWebsite access\n\nSubscribe\n\n### Print Only\n\nWeekly magazine, delivered  \nDaily Newsletter  \nWebsite access\n\nSubscribe\n\n### Digital Only\n\nFree access to 40+ digital editions  \nWebsite access  \nDaily Newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\n© 2019 Newsweek\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n  * About Us\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact Us\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Advertise\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Terms of Sale\n  * Archive\n  * Announcements\n\nConsent preferences\n\n**Editions:**\n\n  * U.S. Edition\n  * 日本\n  * 한국\n  * Pakistan\n  * Polska\n  * România\n\n"

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also\nreceived a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason\nRudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight\non Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his\nrole in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before\nGarrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and\nthen claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting\nhimself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off,\nhe's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine\nRudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he\ndeserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately\nfollowing the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph\ninstigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two\nwere on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before\nGarrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet.\nRudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after\nGarrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to\nrunning back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain\nCam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday\nnight, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to\nsuspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more\nfocused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game\nwinning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko\nof the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of\nthings, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much.\nThat's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to\nlearn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as\nthe NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25\nkickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to\nfacing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I\ndon't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot\n[again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at\nhome, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got\nto put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game,\nso our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\n###  Pick Six Newsletter\n\n####  Get the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks\nand power rankings.\n\nI agree that CBS Sports can send me the \"Pick Six Newsletter\" newsletter.\n\nSee All Newsletters\n\nPlease check the opt-in box to acknowledge that you would like to subscribe.\n\n###  Thanks for signing up!\n\n####  Keep an eye on your inbox for the latest sports news.\n\n###  Sorry!\n\n####  There was an error processing your subscription.\n\n#####  2019 NFL Playoff Picture\n\n  * NFL Scores | Expert Picks | Odds\n  * 2019 NFL playoff picture | Standings\n\n# Join our Free $1,000,000 Parlay Challenge\n\nPlay Now\n\nOur Latest Stories\n\n  * ###  Gronk, Serena perform with Laker Girls \n\n#### Gronk may have found his true calling\n\n  * ###  NFL odds, cheat sheet, picks, bets, sims \n\n#### SportsLine's computer model simulated every Week 12 NFL game 10,000 times\nwith surprising results.\n\n  * ###  Jones tells Belichick story from '90s \n\n#### The Cowboys owner actually might've had a chance to hire Belichick before\nhe went to New England\n\n  * ###  NFL office pool picks for Week 12 \n\n#### SportsLine's advanced computer just locked in its Week 12 NFL office pool\npicks.\n\n  * ###  Pats place Olszewski on IR \n\n#### New England's roster is re-shuffling\n\n  * ###  Playoff picture: Raiders in pursuit \n\n#### Breaking down the 2019 NFL playoff picture after Sunday's Week 11 action\n\n  * ###  Chiefs vs. Chargers: Recap, highlights \n\n#### Kansas City has held on to their lead in the AFC West\n\n  * ###  Rams top Bears as offenses struggle \n\n#### Neither the Rams nor Bears could get much going offensively on Sunday\nnight\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n  * Help\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n  * Advertise\n  * Site Map\n  * Newsletters\n  * Mobile Apps\n  * College Network\n  * Ad Choice\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * Mobile User Agreement\n\nSportsLine.com\n\n© 2004-2019 CBS Interactive.

Instead, they\nlost 24-17.\n\n“We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,”\nLynn said, via the _Los Angeles Times_. “Yes, we needed to win this game\ntoday. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could\ncontrol our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still\nthink we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are\ngoing to need some help.”\n\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would\nprobably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve\nplayed so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning\nrecords, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The\nChargers needed to win that game.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * \n\nPermalink 34 Comments Feed for comments Back to top\n\n##  34 responses to “Anthony Lynn: “We needed to win this game””\n\n  1. **thelastchargersfan** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:34 am\n\nIt’s a good thing we have no fans left because this is a dumpster fire.\n\n  2. **joetoronto** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:44 am\n\nIt’s time for both Chargers fans to come to grips with reality, it’s over yet\nagain.\n\n  3. **theprocess12** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:58 am\n\nAs usual too many mistakes by Rivers. As good as the class of 2004 QBs have\nbeen one of them always leads in INTs. With Hill out the KC offense doesn’t\nlook that dynamic against a decent D. Don’t see how they can win 2 road\nplayoff games.\n\n  4. **v2787** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:02 am\n\nRivers is done. Get a new QB, Chargers. Philip has hit the wall. You’ve got a\ngood team, but you need a QB who won’t throw interceptions. That “shot put”\nstyle of passing that Rivers has isn’t working anymore.\n\n  5. **4hourelection** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:06 am\n\nFeckless Chargers. Always the same.\n\n  6. **margoadams** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:19 am\n\nAnother team suffering from a Super Bowl run hangover, courtesy of your New\nEngland Patriots. Demonstrates once again the incredible 20yr run the Patriots\nhave been on.\n\n  7. **MortimerInMiami** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:23 am\n\nChargers are on the clock!\n\n  8. **sammievee** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:42 am\n\nIf you needed to win, understand that teams that needlessly spike the ball in\nfinal minute, giving up a valuable play while letting a beaten fatigued\ndefense off the hook, usually loses that game. Instead, consider doing what\nlegit teams do–practice during the week while preparing a play just for that\nsituation. Then come up to the line of scrimmage and execute the play as you\nare not going to get a better chance than you had on first down with 24\nseconds left and the opposing defense in utter disarray. Reid was choking\nagain with the game management, I think I saw him doing high fives when Rivers\nspiked the ball and instantly turning the odds of scoring on that drive from\n80% to 15% with that decision to spike the ball in that situation.\n\n  9. **mroklahoma** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:13 am\n\nWhat’s he supposed to say?\n\n  10. **6ringsandarapist** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:32 am\n\nDid anyone really think the Chargers would win?\n\n  11. **lonespeed** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\nPhilip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback. He looked as if he was\nprojecting outward confidence, but he didn’t seem to have confidence in his\nability. Kinda like when you get tired at the end of a long golf round. It\nstarted to manifest itself in mental errors and forced throws that weren’t\ncrisp. Lots of batted balls and throws behind his targets. He might still be\nable to win a handful of games, but his days of leading a team to the playoffs\nare over. My guess is he retires at the end of this season.\n\n  12. **theguiceisright** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:53 am\n\n“Yes, I need to bench Rivers”*\n\nI actually don’t think Tyrod is that bad, plus he looks pretty sweet in a\nchargers uniform\n\n  13. **C. M.** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:56 am\n\nObviously Rivers didn’t want too\n\n  14. **solo681** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nWhy did you not have a plan to bench Rivers, if necessary, just in case – you\nknow, as it was necessary…\n\n  15. **jjackwagon** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nTitans ran the ball right down the throat of the Chiefs D. With Gordon &\nEkeler, it makes you wonder why the Chargers didn’t do the same. Poor game\nplan?\n\nRivers is no longer a QB that can carry a team with his arm but they still\nthink he is.\n\n  16. **shutupbrees** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\ntwo weeks in a row the Chargers run for over 5.0 yards per carry, but insist\non letting Philip Rivers drop back 50+ times. He seems like a good guy, but\nhe’s done. He spends more time barking it up with opponents than any QB I’ve\nseen. It’d be funny if he wasn’t abysmal in the 2 minute drill throwing arm\npunt after arm punt.\n\n  17. **Bob. Just Bob.** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:01 am\n\nTime to put Rivers on the shelf.  \nThe dude just doesn’t have it anymore.  \nHe’s become an interception machine.  \nHe’s always been a risk-taker gunslinger type but it’s now gone past\nridiculous.  \nHave some mercy, Lynn; bench him while he still has a vestige of dignity\nremaining.\n\n  18. **6ringsandarapist** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:04 am\n\nFather time just pulled out his whoopin stick.\n\n  19. **bobmillion** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:13 am\n\nThe Chargers desperately need an O-coordinator that understands the players\nthey have, instead of being that young innovative guru of trying to throw the\nball on almost every play, especially with no tackles, try running the ball.\nThe Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC\ndefense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they\nhave a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in\ndesperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of\nthe year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can\ndo, though Spanos will mess it up.\n\n  20. **jbaxt** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\nTwo things… Why would you stop running Gordon?\n\nAlso, several “experts” picked the Chargers to win the AFC West.\n\n  21. **devindenv** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:41 am\n\nChiefs Offense, without Hill, isn’t as dymnamic – as the poster above stated.\nIs that any f-ing surprise? But to say they cannot win 2 road playoff games\noverlooks the fact that the O-line. last night, was the first time in 6 weeks\nthey have Eric Fisher back and the starting LG was back for the first time 3-4\nweeks. Furthermore, tey are still down their best CB and a starting DE. The\nBye week comes at a great time for them. We shall see as they have OAK in Week\n13 and the Patriots in Week 14.\n\n  22. **fartweasel** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:32 am\n\nRivers is done. He just hasn’t accepted it yet. Great career, but his skills\nhave diminished. Time to retire.\n\n  23. **patsfan4lifesbchamps** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\nAnthony Lynn is in over his head\n\n  24. **psi0016000** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:46 am\n\nThe Chargers should sign Kapernick and make him the starter for the WHOLE 2020\nseason. In doing so, they will put and end to this ridiculous saga between\nKaper and the NFL, where both sides are at fault.  \nThis will also make possible, the transition from a declining and pathetic\nwould be Hall of Famer, to a long time ago Super Bowl Runner up. Who knows …  \nAnd then they should make a priority of ending up the 2020 draft, and 2020\nfree agency, with a boat load of OL, some of them being outright homeruns.\n\nOne last note : hire Dan Fouts as an assistant QB coach.\n\nHow about them Chargers !!!!\n\n  25. **Why I Love Football** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\n“Their going to need help along the way” ? … Man, the Chargers are going to\nneed someone like Moses to lead them to the playoffs. I think Coach Lynn\nneeded this win more than anyone in order to stay employed. Chargers and Bears\nare in a league of their own. They are stuck with no where to go.\n\n  26. **smarter than you** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:07 pm\n\nWhat a worthless team, no history, no tradition, ugly uniforms, I’d rather be\na Bengals fan\n\n  27. **averagjoe** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\n\nThe look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should\nend all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n\n  28. **grumpysal** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:39 pm\n\nWatching last night’s game was like i was re-watching their game from a few\nweeks ago (?) where Rivers basically did the same thing (INT on last play) – I\nwondered during that game why the OC didn’t run the ball more and again last\nnight.\n\nAfter being IN that game a few weeks ago, did the Chargers coaches think a\ndifferent outcome was going to happen? I mean, do they even watch Rivers\nduring the game? He was downright awful.\n\n  29. **MightyMidwest** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:18 pm\n\nMight as well take your ball & go to Sacramento, San Diego, Portland or\nwherever.\n\nMaybe Mexico City is an option?\n\n  30. **cafetero1075** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\nRivers has had bad seasons and bounced back. I think he can play well next\nyear.\n\n  31. **captainwhodat** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 2:25 pm\n\n“We needed to win this game”…said captain obvious.\n\n  32. **jjfootball** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 3:43 pm\n\nHis arm is a noodle at this point!\n\n  33. **a1b24312** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:34 pm\n\nMaybe JFisher wasn’t so bad after all? I mean, at least you got to 8-8 and one\nSB…\n\n  34. **Guy Hence** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:22 pm\n\naveragjoe says:  \nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm  \nThe look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should\nend all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.  \n==============================  \none quick read of your post tells us that you dont know a damn thing about\nfootball, the HOF or who should qualify.  \nRivers – even in his decline – is STILL better than your QB.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.

Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying\nfinished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's\ntournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat\nHungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for\nRyan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the\nsemifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro\n2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA\nNations League.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\n### There's still a chance for these teams\n\nAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a\nspot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each\npath having one berth:\n\n **Path A** : **** Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*  \n **Path B** : Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern\nIreland  \n **Path C** : Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*  \n **Path D** : Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus\n\n_*A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill\nthe empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A._\n\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.\n\n### Clinching in November\n\nOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at\nIreland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before,\nPortugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and\nCristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one\nshot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories\nout of eight in all competitions.\n\nCroatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia\nsecured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout\nof Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern\nIreland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\n\nOn Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against\nLiechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\n\nAnd earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot,\nand that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with\nthe reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites. Below\nare all the teams that qualified for the tournament during the group stage.\n\n### Qualified teams\n\n  * England (Group A): 10th appearance\n  * Czech Republic (Group A): Seventh appearance\n  * Ukraine (Group B): Third appearance\n  * Spain (Group F): 11th appearance\n  * Sweden (Group F): Seventh appearance\n  * Poland (Group G): Fourth appearance \n  * France (Group H): 10th appearance\n  * Turkey (Group H): Fifth appearance\n  * Belgium (Group I): Sixth appearance\n  * Russia (Group I): 12th appearance\n  * Italy (Group J): 10th appearance\n  * Finland (Group J): Zero appearances\n  * Croatia (Group E): Sixth appearance\n  * Austria (Group G): Third appearance\n  * Netherlands (Group C): 10th appearance\n  * Germany (Group C): 13th appearance\n  * Switzerland (Group D): Fifth appearance\n  * Denmark (Group D): Ninth appearance\n  * Portugal (Group B): Eighth appearance\n  * Wales (Group E): Second appearance\n\n**Roger Gonzalez**\n\nCBS Sports Writer\n\nfollow\n\nRoger Gonzalez is an award-winning writer based in Virginia that has covered\npro soccer from Europe's top clubs to Argentina's first division.

Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent,\nwhile sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new\nvehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n“People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,”\nInfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as\n2018.”\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:** Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan\nstayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage\nrate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2\npercent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based\nautomobile data firm.\n\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten\ndeals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a\nquarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder\nof the year.\n\n“The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle\npurchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry\nanalysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or\nSUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower\nfinancing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:** Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing.\nThe average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014,\nup from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the\naverage price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New\ninfotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup\ncameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up,\nMcDowell said.\n\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments\n-- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle\nsales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September,\nit’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month\naverage of 15.2 percent.\n\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an\nincrease of just 0.3 percent from 2017.

It’s part of a larger pollution\nproblem in India. Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nAnother cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million\nresidents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is\nlikely to reach “severe” or “emergency” levels on Wednesday. The dangerous,\ndirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and\nrural smoke converging over India’s capital region.\n\nIt’s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhi’s Chief\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as\na “gas chamber.”\n\n> Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in\n> neighbouring states  \n>  \n> It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt &\n> govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today  \n>  \n> I urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\n>\n> — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public\nhealth emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to\nschoolchildren.\n\nLast week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and\npollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health\nOrganization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes\nin a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor\nand reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a\nrating of “hazardous.”\n\nAir pollution in Delhi remains “unhealthy” this week.  Berkeley Earth\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and\nit’s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health\nOrganization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the\nmost pollution from PM2.5 — particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter\nthat can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems — were in\nIndia. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there\nwere 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world.\nIndia suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of\nthese deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies\nof 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when\npollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for\nyears, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the\ncountry **** and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is\nworsening for Indians.\n\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many\nemerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies\nurbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem\nwith roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to\ndistinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water\nconservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in\nbetter governance.\n\n### Why Delhi’s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of\nTexas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and\ndilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in\nDelhi, there’s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up\ntrapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is\nalso landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi’s\nmore than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles\nrun on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke\nmotors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80\npercent of the region’s total pollution. Dust from the city’s construction\nboom is also a contributor to the city’s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid\nfuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\nThese sources contribute to Delhi’s year-round pollution. But there are\nseveral additional factors making air quality even worse now.\n\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning\nfires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu\nfestival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off\nfireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October\n27 this year.\n\n> The air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly\n> predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every\n> November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by\n> the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks.\n> pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n>\n> — Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi’s pollution right now isn’t\ncoming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of\nyear burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and\nrestore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these\nfires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of\nresidents. “It’s like you’re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink\nthat’s plugged up,” Apte said. “It overflows with spectacular consequences.”\n\n### Delhi’s air wasn’t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the\nrise in pollution.\n\n“I’m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never\nexperienced this pollution,” said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the\nCenter for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. “The\n[severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened\nin 2009?”\n\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India’s\nbreadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this\nregion helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and\nharming air quality.  Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage\nas farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To\ncombat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of\nSubsoil Water Act.\n\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice\nproduction typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first\ncultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act\nprohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The\ndelay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab’s water\ntable. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October\nrice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter\nwheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can’t hire a large\nnumber of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields\nof the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and\nquickest method to prepare for the next planting — burning crop stubble.\n\nThis satellite image from NASA’s worldview satellite shows fires detected\n(red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.  NASA Worldview\n\nOf course, it’s not just rural pollution that’s choking Delhi. The urban\nsources of pollution — traffic, construction, cooking fires — have also\nincreased as the region’s population has boomed by more than 7 million people\nin the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air\nquality in Delhi in recent years.\n\n### Delhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are\nreluctant to take aggressive action\n\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting\n210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops\nand explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials\nalso implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of\nthe cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers.\nRoughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules.\nHowever, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop\nburning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and\nfarmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\n\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air\nquality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it’s\nbecause of shifts in the weather — not policy.\n\n“This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to\nsouth-easterly, which allowed Delhi’s air to slightly improve,” Kurinji\nSelvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment\nand Water think tank told CBS News.\n\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to\nschoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.  Sonu Mehta/Hindustan\nTimes/Getty Images\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the\nsources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. “Part of\nthe challenge is that there’s a character of ‘Oh no, you first,’ ‘No, you\nfirst,’” Apte said. “No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would\nlead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily\nsharing equal portions of the blame.”\n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also\na political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers,\nconstruction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have\na seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid\nthe pollution — many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious\nminority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old\nsectarian wounds.\n\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India’s last\nelection cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to\nstop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning,\ndriving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n“People will be up in revolt, they’ll stop trains, there will be riots, and\nnobody wants to get into this hassle,” Prakash said. “It’s actually a very,\nvery noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto\npoints.”\n\n### Air pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has\nbeen fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air\nquality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from\ndangerous smog.\n\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County\nregularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the\ncountry as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air\npollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many\nhave made important progress in consistently improving air quality by\nenforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology.\nThe persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of\neconomic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist\nSimon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is\nimpoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but\nbeyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as\npollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are\nimplemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an\nagrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is\ngetting the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops,\npollution gets worse before it gets better. Ecological Economics\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash\nsaid. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their\nair quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that\nChina’s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian\ngovernment, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories\nand limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it\ngets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of\nindustrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n“The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do\nit,” Prakash said. “Nothing stands between the decision and the\nimplementation.”\n\nThat’s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To\nclear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies\nand incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics,\nhelping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their\nharvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward\ncharity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers\nand reduce pollution.\n\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner\nenergy. “If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to\npollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,” Prakash said. It’s\nnot just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and\ntrucks.\n\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in\nDelhi. Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable\nenergy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action\nSummit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would\nmore than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to\n450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in\nfossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for\neconomic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to\naccept the tradeoffs.\n\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used,\na region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make\na difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money,\nand foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing\nmetropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos,\nNigeria. “The problem can be solved,” Prakash said. “But what you need is\npolitical will and a bit of imagination.”\n\n##  Next Up In Science & Health\n\n  * A clever new solar solution to one of the trickiest climate problems\n  * How Apollo moon rocks reveal the epic history of the cosmos\n  * These senators are going after the biggest climate villains in Washington\n  * Brazil’s Amazon rainforest destruction is at its highest rate in more than a decade \n  * Trump’s controversial vaping flavor ban is now dead\n  * With impeachment, America’s epistemic crisis has arrived\n\n###  Most Read\n\n  1.

For this years’ edition of\n**Amsterdam Light Festival** artists, designers and architects from sixteen\ndifferent countries share their interpretation of the central theme **_‘The\nMedium is the Message’_**. All participating artworks will be lit\nsimultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition –\nin the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different\nways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time,\nvisitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be\npresented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the\nfestival. **Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019**.\n\n_Cover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros\nDesign at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival_\n\n* * *\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\n**Ivana Jelić and Pavle Petrović** (Serbia) found inspiration for their work\n** _Starry Night_** in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the\nbeginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution,\nstarry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation\nStarry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night\nback, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\n**Groupe LAPS** (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and\noften integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the\nfestival, the French artist collective designed **_Spider on the Bridge_** :\neighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on\nthe bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion\nthat the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors\nare warned!\n\n**Amigo & amigo** (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone\nChua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their\ntechnically complex artworks. **_Parabolic Lightcloud_** is a cloud of light\nmade with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this\ninstallation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors\nto think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts.\nMoreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope\nmade out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\n**OGE Group** (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and\nGaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work\nis characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with\n**_Light a Wish_ **as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment\nyou blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the\nair. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions\nfloat above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the\nfestival.\n\n**Balmond Studio** (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The\nstudio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With\n**_Optilli,_** Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the\nsubjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon\nas the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The\nquestion is: is the displayed image correct?\n\n* * *\n\n**Light as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam**  \nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty\nartworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme **_‘The Medium is\nthe Message_** ‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and\nphilosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the\nway we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The\nparticipating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play\nas a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise\nhave remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories\nis also a central part of this edition.  \nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of\nremarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be\nreleased as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn\nidentifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\n* * *\n\n**Some of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light\nFestival – previews**\n\n_Light a Wish by OGE Group_\n\n_Parabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo_\n\n_Portam Civitatis by Peter Snijder_\n\n_Spider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS_\n\n**7th Amsterdam Light Festival**  \n**29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019**\n\n* * *\n\nsponsored links\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## More in Amsterdam\n\n#### Amsterdam\n\n### sponsored links\n\n* * *\n\n### Search Inexhibit\n\n  \n  \n\n### InDi Design Index\n\n### Specials\n\n  * ### The design of everyday technology\n\n  * ### Visionary computer design of the past\n\n  * ### Examples of digital communication technology in culture and education\n\n  * ### Venice Art Biennale 2017 | info, program, exhibitions, and events\n\n  * ### Wood Architecture & Design\n\n  * ### 58th Venice Biennale of Art 2019 | May You Live in Interesting Times\n\n  * ### Museums of archaeology and archaeological sites around the world\n\n  * ### 16th Venice Architecture Biennale 2018 – pavilions, program, events\n\n  * ### Venice Architecture Biennale 2016 – Reporting from the Front – INDEX\n\n  * ### Venice Art Biennale 2015 – All the World’s Futures – Index\n\n### recently-added locations\n\n  * ### Mantua and Cremona\n\n  * ### Naples and Campania\n\n  * ### Chicago\n\n  * ### San Francisco\n\n  * ### Washington, D.C.\n\n  * ### Turin\n\n  * ### Dallas – Fort Worth\n\n  * ### Innsbruck and Austrian Tyrol\n\n### Subscribe to Inexhibit’s newsletter\n\n* * *\n\ncopyright Inexhibit 2019 - ISSN: 2283-5474\n\n  * About Inexhibit\n  * Copyright\n  * Contact Us\n  * Advertise\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookies\n  * Newsletter\n  * Cookie policy\n\n____\n\n__\n\n  * HOME\n  * Architecture\n  * Design\n  * Art\n  * Cities\n  * myMuseum\n  * Specials\n  * English\n    * Italian\n\n"

The demand has US\nofficials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of\nimproved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect\nintellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back\nexisting tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of\ntariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper\nconcessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger\nthan just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China\nscholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will\nagree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it\nwill benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to\nsee China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\nmaintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to\ncampaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to\nvoters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product\npurchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand\ndictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion\nworth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from\nthe 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and\nconsumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in\nannual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he\nwould likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since\nthe trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such\nconcessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual\nproperty and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a\nsecond person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed\nto any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that\nI like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an\nOctober news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could\nnow be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\nDH Newsletter  Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n\nGET IT\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\ntrade war\n\nTrade deal\n\n0 Comments (+)\n\n###  Related stories\n\n####  India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n\n####  Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\n\n####  China cuts new benchmark rate to boost economy\n\n####  Khamenei says enemy 'repelled' in protest-hit Iran\n\n####  Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n####  Last campus protesters hold out as HK schools reopen...\n\n### DH Picks\n\n  * ####  PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr... \n\n  * ####  Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year \n\n  * ####  KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams... \n\n  * ####  Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill \n\n  * ####  Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes... \n\n##  social feed\n\n#### What does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n  * Politics\n  * North and Central\n  * South\n  * East and Northeast\n  * West\n\nKarnataka\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Politics\n  * Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Bengaluru Crime\n  * Politics\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n  * Cricket\n  * ICC World Cup 2019\n  * Formula 1 with DH\n  * Football\n  * Tennis\n  * Sportscene\n  * Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n  * Business News\n  * Budget 2019\n  * Economy & Business\n  * Family Finance\n  * Technology\n  * DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n  * Videos\n  * Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n  * DH Views\n  * Editorials\n  * Panorama\n  * Comment\n  * In Perspective\n  * Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n  * Entertainment News\n  * DH Talkies\n  * Arts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\n  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep \n  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\n  * India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n  * Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK \n  * Blood-stained dress of Congress MLA in Kerala Assembly\n  * NCLAT rejects DBS Bank's plea \n  * Arrests ordered in Philippines vaping ban\n\nTrending news\n\n  * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n  * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n  * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n  * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n  * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\n  * About\n  * Epaper\n  * Newsletter\n  * Archives\n  * Sitemap\n  * Classifieds\n  * Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n  * Printers Mysore\n  * Prajavani\n  * Sudha\n  * Mayura\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms\n  * Disclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  *   *   *   *   * X Share via\n    *     *     *     * Share permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user\nexperience.

Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven’t. Why?\nBecause space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday\nenlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space\nindustry’s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s\nSpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon\nshot.\n\n#### More:\n\n  * #### The New Space Race\n\n  * #### Spacewalking into 'her-story'\n\n  * #### China completes landing test for its first Mars mission in 2020\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had\nenhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator\nfor exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference\ncall with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon\nas soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human\nexploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for\ncontracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments,\nand to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the\nspace agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next\nyear, only two committed  to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the\nInspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted\n“technical challenges, cost increases and  schedule delays”. The report and\nMonday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020\nbudget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even\nfeasible.\n\nIn May, NASA’s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was\nnecessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to\nMars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter’s moon\nEuropa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water\nvapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential\ningredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water -\nare on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of\neligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased\nthe total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue\nOrigin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been\non last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that\nare taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice\npresident of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting\ntimes. We’re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted\nto expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two\nrelatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite\nSystems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a\ncombined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires\nan entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and\nFounder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX\nand Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players.\nAnd we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity\nthat adds to the mix.”\n\nSOURCE: Al Jazeera News\n\n* * *\n\n### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLaura Winter\n\n* * *\n\n  * Science & Technology\n  * Space\n  * United States\n  * Business & Economy\n  * US & Canada\n\nHave your say.Give us feedback.\n\nSign up for ourNewsletter.\n\n* * *\n\n  * News\n  * Programmes\n  * Opinion\n  * About\n  * Investigations\n  * Contact Us\n  * Video\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n  * Podcast\n  * YouTube\n  * SnapChat\n\n###  About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Code of Ethics\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Work for us\n  * HR Quality\n\n###  Connect\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Apps\n  * Social\n  * Channel Finder\n  * TV Schedule\n  * Podcasts\n  * Newsletter\n  * Submit a Tip\n  * Directory\n\n###  Our Channels\n\n  * Al Jazeera Arabic\n  * Al Jazeera English\n  * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n  * Al Jazeera Documentary\n  * Al Jazeera Balkans\n  * AJ+\n\n###  Our Network\n\n  * Jetty\n  * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n  * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n  * Learn Arabic\n  * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n  * Al Jazeera Forum\n  * Al Jazeera Film Festival\n  * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\n© 2019 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"

Wait,\nwhat?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big\nMachine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which\nalready held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops\ngetting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become\nan incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks\nbegin circling*\n\n **Back to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?**\n\nIt’s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka\noriginal recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the\nAmerican Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to\ntheir original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an\nartist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in\nSwift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist\nfinancially.\n\n**He said, she said**\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The\nCarlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ...\nbecause hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has\ndenied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift\nfans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\n **The bottom line ...**\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be\nre-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the\nradio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to\nBig Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music\nGroup, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to\ndeserve this?\"\n\n _Why Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday\nhighs earlier in the session.\n\nTraders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and\nChina could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to\ndrift and bond prices to go higher.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if\nno deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of\ntariffs is due to start in mid-December.\n\nOil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut\nits oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month.\n\nSeparately, Norway’s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential\noversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent\nprices lower.\n\n“Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,”\nCommerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at\n$60.73, down 2.74% on the day.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or\n0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18\nand the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66.\n\nHopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year\nhigh and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two\nyears, but those gains were pared later in the session.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.12% while MSCI’s gauge of stocks\nacross the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight\nsession of gains.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific\nshares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan’s Nikkei\nfutures NKc1 lost 0.66%.\n\nLong-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%,\ndown from 1.808% late on Monday.\n\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from\n2.293% late on Monday.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The\ndollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075.\n\nWhile the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered\nexpectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez,\nsenior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.\n\n“Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus\nrisk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact\nthat the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed’s ability to satisfy\nanyone is in question,” Perez said.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar,\nwhile Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.\n\nSpot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.\n\nCopper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to\n$1,737.00 a tonne.\n\n(Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - here)\n\n(Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - here)\n\n(Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - here)\n\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Saqib\nIqbal Ahmed and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan\nGrebler\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n0 : 0\n\n  * narrow-browser-and-phone\n  * medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\n  * landscape-tablet\n  * medium-wide-browser\n  * wide-browser-and-larger\n  * medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\n  * medium-wide-browser-and-larger\n  * above-phone\n  * portrait-tablet-and-above\n  * above-portrait-tablet\n  * landscape-tablet-and-above\n  * landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\n  * portrait-tablet-and-below\n  * landscape-tablet-and-below\n\n  * Apps\n  * Newsletters\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Advertising Guidelines\n  * Cookies\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of\nclimbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan\nyour next jump.\n\nIt’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking,\ndodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star\nWars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally\nancient tombs.\n\nWhere it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I\ninstead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other\ngames and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\nFallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding\nas a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge\nof the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the\nprequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to\nget you on board with the premise.\n\nOne of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic\ncharacters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan\nare briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction\ntends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the\nvery end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-\nexecuted, but ultimately doesn’t matter to the general story.\n\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the\nForce, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly\nadorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them\nuse Greez’s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With\nthe exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time\nto grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in\nbleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character.\n\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction – and my god, every\nlittle animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an\ninquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial\nrobots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s\nBT-7274.\n\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to\nobtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find\nsaid civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little\nbearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn’t so much\nthe need to get the _things_ , as it was to spend more time with these\nincredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways.\nTaking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will\nonly be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes\nrequire a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\nThis means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets\neven as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about\nsending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the\nnext, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want\nto.\n\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just\nby exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that\nenemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I\nmanaged to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different\npoint through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer\nplayers the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated\nmess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might\nfind in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at\nany point – such a lifesaver.\n\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible\nand which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked\noff require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s\na more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates\nsome of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous\nlevels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems\nentirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend\nminutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and\nwatch a cutscene.\n\nIn your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The\nwildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and\nhave harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in\na single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a\nbigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers,\nhowever – units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee\nweapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more\nmanageable.\n\n  \n_The best new character in 2019._\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three\ntogether, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these\nsort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\nYou’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in\none hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get\nrid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have\nto push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the\ncrowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge\nTroopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out\nthe power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on\nMaster), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as\nyou would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone\nplaying The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the\nlower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would\nlove to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to\nget stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\nFallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its\nown rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy\nessentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are\nblocked. After it depletes, you’ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go\non the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-\nstepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where\nit falters is the execution.\n\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through\nyour roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to\njust holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable,\nbut it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll\nthrough and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some\nconsistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time\nit right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a\nfight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you\npull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment\nas a result of the parry.\n\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into\nthe blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry.\nThis caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing\nright. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save\nfor bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated\nand you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t\nworking.\n\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up\nwith enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and\nblocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I\nfound that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often\neasier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that\nwindow to attack.\n\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if\nForce powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me.\n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in\ntraversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the\nlimited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the\naforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to\nfrustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those\nedges, and it may get there eventually – but right now, lack of polish is\nholding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my\nenjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to\nplayers on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident,\nfocused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win.\n\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired\nby, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but\nRespawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside\nthose hallowed inspirations.\n\nAnd yes, it doesn’t always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but\nrespect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are\nserviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star\nWars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and\naction game players looking for a decent – albeit flawed – combat.\n\n_Version tested: PC._\n\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Glass was 20-of-24 passing\nfor 235 yards.\n\nThe Eagles led 14-7 at halftime before scoring 24 points in the third quarter\nfor a 38-10 bulge.\n\nHuskies quarterback Marcus Childers was intercepted three times and lost a\nfumble. Tre Harbison rushed for 112 yards on 30 carries for NIU.\n\nThe three previous games between these programs went to overtime.\n\n### **Extra points**\n\nThe status of quarterback Tanner Morgan is uncertain for Minnesota’s game at\nNorthwestern after back-to-back sacks in the last game put the sophomore in\nthe concussion protocol.\n\nCoach P.J. Fleck said Morgan has made progress this week, but the Big Ten’s\nleading passer has not been cleared. The Gophers (9-1, 6-1) play Saturday\nagainst the Wildcats (2-8, 0-7), with a one-game lead in the West Division on\nWisconsin.\n\nMorgan could be a game-time decision. If he doesn’t play, either Jacob Clark\nor Cole Kramer would start. They’re both true freshmen that Fleck would prefer\nto keep at the four-game limit to preserve their redshirt status.\n\n... Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford said he received death threats on\nsocial media after the Nittany Lions’ Nov. 9 loss at Minnesota.\n\n... Vanderbilt athletic director Malcolm Turner said Derek Mason has his full\nsupport as the Commodores coach and they’ll be working together to give the\nfootball program the resources and support needed to succeed.\n\nPublished 11:11 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper\n\n"

(Photo Credit : PTI File Photo )\n\nIn case you are living in Delhi-NCR, chances are you have an app or two to\nfind out the latest air quality index in your area. Since Diwali, despite the\nSupreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the\nmonitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become\na standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower\nsurface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the\nNational Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social\nmedia about an ‘oxygen bar’!\n\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Condé Nast\nTraveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about\nthis unique ‘bar’. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone\nwho is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we\nhave an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and\nlanded up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi’s Saket area that offers\nthis unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is\n‘Oxy Pure’. “An Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched\nwith an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air\npollutants in a cost-effective manner,” the description on the website reads.\n\nOffering ‘rejuvenating’ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, “consists\nof an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating\ncustomers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula\nalong with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you\nwith more vigour and energy.”\n\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and\nMargarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas\nand decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299\nfor fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to\nvisit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right\nnow is 218, which is in ‘poor’ category.\n\nFirst Published: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 08:38 AM\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Tags:\n\n  * Delhi Pollution \n  * Delhi Smog \n  * Oxygen \n  * Saket \n  * Air Quality \n\n0 Post Comment (+)\n\nLIVE TV VIdeos Photos\n\n### Photo Gallery\n\n  * __\n\n## Happy Birthday Rajkumar Hirani: 5 Movies Of The Director That You Can Watch\nOn Loop\n\n  * __\n\n## International Men’s Day: Most Handsome Classic Actors That Even Put John\nLegend To Shame\n\n  *   * __\n\n## Happy Birthday Sushmita Sen: These Pictures Of Former Miss Universe With\nRohman Shawl Are Just Unmissable!\n\n  * __\n\n## Farhan Akhtar's Girlfriend Shibani Dandekar Sets Internet On Fire With\nSuper-Sexy Pictures\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Career\n  * Advertise With Us\n  * Complaint Redressal\n  * Contact Us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sitemap\n  * RSS\n\n© 2019 News Nation.

Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's\nthird child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10,\nduring which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of\nEpstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\nAndrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get\npizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me\nto do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\nAndrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with\nGiuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he\nhad a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.\n\n“Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”\n\nBut, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he\nexplained that he can sweat now.\n\nAndrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if\nthere was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they\nwere friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply\ncan’t remember.\n\n“There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if\nthere was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the\n[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’\ncampaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about\ngetting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to\nlook for but I never saw them.”\n\nThe fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t\nseem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\nAs if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the\naccusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with\nEpstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In\nother words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can\nteach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\nThe interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in\nassociating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre _said_ before the interview. \"And I\nhope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nAndrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent\ndenials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from\npoliticians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as\nKatie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their\nconnections with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his\n_publicist quitting_. After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more\ncareful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what\nappears to be guilt.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nRoyals\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nSexual Assault\n\nMedia\n\n  * __\n  * __\n\n__ Share your thoughts with friends.\n\n  * \n\n  * #####  More Washington Examiner \n\n    * #####  Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago\nTuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed\nand arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are\nhighly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his\nnightmare will finally end.\n\n    * #####  Prince Andrew struggles to dispel allegations of sex with 17-year-old girl supplied by Epstein\n\nRob Crilly\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nThe television interview was devised as an opportunity for Britain’s Prince\nAndrew to set the record straight on his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey\nEpstein and end questions about whether he had slept with a 17-year-old girl.\n\n    * #####  What made _Joker_ so popular?\n\nMadeline Fry\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nJoker killed at the box office.\n\n    * #####  Sen.

David Perdue\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nWednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home\nstate of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.\n\n    * #####  Surprise! Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press,\nNational Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study\nshowed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S.\ndetention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest\nrate of children in detention.”\n\n    * #####  Marie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so\nfar with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of\nthe impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\n    * #####  Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and\npersonal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including\nAmbassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie\nYovanovitch.\n\n    * #####  'Hate to cause a stink': FCC chairman declines call to investigate alleged Swalwell flatulence\n\nDaniel Chaitin\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe mystery of whether Rep. Eric Swalwell passed gas during an MSNBC interview\nwill squeak past scrutiny from the federal agency in charge of regulating the\nairwaves.\n\n    * #####  Kurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting\nAmbassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine\npolicy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker\nsought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday,\nmaking himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n    * #####  Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nPeople are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment\n“scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly\nclosed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his\njob. Here is what we learned:\n\n    * #####  Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-\nUkraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to\nUkraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr\nZelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n    * #####  First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be\nheld on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n    * #####  Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\nTiana Lowe\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did\nPresident Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign\ngovernment to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats\nattempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the\npivot bombed fantastically.\n\n    * #####  It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on\nTuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with\nUkraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not\nleak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n    * #####  Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nMonday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no\nlonger donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community\nleft some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the\nmilitant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\ncontinue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the\nannouncement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold\nChristian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\"\nwill not be satisfied.\n\n    * #####  'Just not accurate': GOP congressman rips _New York Times_ over Vindman tweet\n\nDominick Mastrangelo\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin accused the New York Times of spreading misinformation during\nits live coverage of congressional impeachment hearings.\n\n  * About Examiner\n\n  * Magazine Archive\n\n  * Staff\n\n  * Advertise\n\n  * Contact\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n###### Copyright 2019.

Afterwards, The Tennis Podcast\nteam of Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts gave their initial\nimpressions of the new format.\n\nIs it fair to say that the event was neither as bad as the sceptics thought it\nwould be, nor as good as the organisers hoped it would be? Was it a\nmisjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some\nBelgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled\ndifferently to make sure it is always live? And in what way was an authentic\nDavis Cup atmosphere created by fans on the smaller stadiums?\n\nMuch of the focus on day one was about the feel and staging of the event,\nrather than forehands and backhands, but there’s also discussion about\nRussia’s straightforward victory against defending champions Croatia,\nColombia’s valiant effort against Belgium, and Canada’s exciting win over\nItaly.\n\nThe Tennis Podcast is produced weekly throughout the year, daily during the\nGrand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP Finals, and the Fed Cup and Davis Cup\nFinals.\n\n  * This week's Tennis Podcast is sponsored by the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals, which takes place 18-24 November.

Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is\nstocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel\nStudios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”\n\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had\nforgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day\nreported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being\nabruptly logged off the service.\n\n“We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make\nme feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and\ninternational, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in\nHollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the\nsoftware as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout\nthe week.\n\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming\nservice\n\n(Walt Disney Co.)\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial,\nalthough it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer\nhinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n“We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer\nsaid.\n\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and,\npotentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its\nbusiness. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s flagship\nESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services,\nsuch as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3\nbillion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take\non Netflix at its own game.\n\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the\nso-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n“We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will\nsucceed.”\n\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best\npositioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up\nfor. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he\nthinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether\nsubscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to\nstream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+\napp. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast\nnetworks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its\nsports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that\nwould probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n“There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said.\n“We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.”\n\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a\npotential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the\ndesign and last week’s rollout of the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international\ndivision in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and\ncorporate strategy executive at the company.\n\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and\nBamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological\nbackbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.\n\nIt’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-\non operational role.\n\n“Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what\nI’m doing.”  \n\n* * *\n\nCompany TownTelevisionBusinessEntertainment & Arts\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet our daily Entertainment newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nMeg James\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * email\n  * facebook\n\nMeg James is a corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, covering\nthe business of television and digital disruption in the entertainment\nindustry.

Skimming device found at Eagan Kwik Trip \n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild\ncoach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he\nalways finds a way to start scoring.\n\n“It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a\nlittle bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over\nthe Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.”\n\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is\nbrimming with confidence.\n\nParise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56\n– gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third\nperiod.\n\n“That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing\nthings for the team.”\n\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild\ndefenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks,\ncould see the frustration on his friend’s face.\n\n“He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said.\n\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just\nthree four times in his first 18 games.\n\n“You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little\nwhile. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.”\n\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the\nneutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one.\n\nHe tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n“He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need\nthose goals.”\n\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been\non his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n“It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know\nwhat we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step\nforward.”\n\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in\nyourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.”\n\n“You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told\nthem. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start\nbelieving in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n“I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because\nI knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.”\n\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching\nstart, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In\nthe second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw\npunches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n“I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and,\nlike, I just wasn’t ready for it.”\n\nParise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under\ntheir skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.”\n\nEichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan\nDubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots.\nSabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third\nperiod.\n\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason\nZucker’s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an\nundisclosed injury.\n\n“I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said.\n\n  * Tags: \n  * Minnesota Wild\n\n###  Bill Hoppe\n\nAs you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.\nOur goal with article comments is to provide a space for civil, informative\nand constructive conversations.

Follow us at Twitter@igndeals._We bring you the best\ndeals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of\nrandom stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is\napproaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black\nFriday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday\nadscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\n## PS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to\nBlack Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the\nDualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its\ncolor and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to\nlook grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for 39.99\n\n## Nintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword\nor Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition.\nWe haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and\nthis bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even\non Black Friday).  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $238.99\n\n## King of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R\nCurved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming\nmonitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming\nmonitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include\na 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and\n99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz\nrefresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely\nlove it, both for work and for games.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $649.99\n\n## New Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99\n(Originally $200)\n\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll\nsave $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most\npeople probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates\ncompared to the Series 3. What everyone **will** appreciate, though, is the\nextra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's\nwaterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small,\nsleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $169.99\n  * Also at Walmart\n\n## New Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139\n(Originally $159)\n\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very\npopular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped\ntoday to the lowest price we've ever seen.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $139\n  * Also at Walmart\n\n## 45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift\ncard, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're\nessentially getting it for $499.  \n\n  * Get it at Dell for $549\n\n## Dell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD\nfor $799.99\n\n**Use code \"50OFF699\"**  \n  \n****This is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX\n1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw\nperformance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of\nmemory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.  \n\n  * **Use code \"50OFF699\"** to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\n## Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\n**Clip the $10 off coupon on the product page**  \n  \nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and\nnon-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive\nscore and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk\nX4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters\ncan't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds),\nanything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if\nyou run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $67.77\n\n## Get Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\n**_This sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane._**  \n  \nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password)\nfor every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites\nexperiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to\nuncover your login info one day—and if you use the same credentials across\nmultiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your\nsensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by\nrandomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and\nautomatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of\nthe best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its\nsoftware that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill\nfunctionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is\navailable) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web\nMonitoring, and secure VPN.  \n\n  * Download Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n## 4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but **you\ndon't have to be a Prime member**. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music\nUnlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service\n(or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed,\nbut it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make\nsure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free\nversions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists\nthat you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.  \n\n  * Get 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n## $10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or\nGray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't\nseen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is\nstill $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $249.95\n\n## New Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with\nBonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian\nand Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the\nsame titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are\nnon-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch\nPro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't\nplay in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to\nplay the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.  \n\n  * Get it with Free Case at Walmart for $199.96\n  * Get it by itself on Amazon for $199\n\n## New Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon\nCredit\n\n_\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its\nmost tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\"_ Read our Pokemon\nSword and Shield review _._  \n  \nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has\nthe best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if\nyou get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but\nwe confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it\nwill end very, very soon so hurry!  \n\n  * Get Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\n  * Get Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n\n## 70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\n\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday\nseason. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated\nSmart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for\nextended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart\nby January for whatever reason).  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n## $15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and\nthe upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with\nactive noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to\n5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets\nof silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell,\nand a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life.\nIf you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling\nyourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go\nout of stock very soon.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $234.98\n\n## 30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City\n2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\n\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\"\nwide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the\n\"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate\nCollector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary\ndifference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability\nwhereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever\nfor the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.  \n\n  * ~~Get it on Amazon for $243.97~~\n\n## Disney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package\nand Save $5/Month\n\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar,\nMarvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription. This is\nalso currently the only way to watch the new big Star Wars TV series, The\nMandalorian, which airs starting today.  \n  \nIf you just want Disney+, you can sign up for a free 7-day trial. Afterwards\nyou'll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you're in it for the long haul, then\nyou can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.  \n  \nAn even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+\nbundle. In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee\nservices separately, you'd be paying around $17.99 per month, so you'd be\nsaving $60 every year.  \n  \n**Note:** The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-\nfree Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle\nplan. Here's the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the\nDisney+ bundled package:  \n\n  * Sign up for a Hulu ad-free account for $11.99 a month\n  * If you already have a Hulu account, visit your account page to upgrade\n  * Sign up for the Disney+ bundle using the same email as your Hulu account\n\n## ______________________________\n\n_Eric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts._\n\nIf you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

While some people\ncarry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their\npersonal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are\nwriting custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely\nproud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has\nredefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"—and someone he's\nlearned a lot from.\n\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the\nDreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote\nwith a couple songs.\n\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he\ndid an internship at the company.\n\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base\nas the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on\nmobile devices.\n\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don’t even own a computer\nanymore and I don’t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good\njob.\"\n\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly\nincorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told\nBenioff.\n\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba\nBuena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the\nsame stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script\nin a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to\nexchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such\na great leader.\n\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he\npassed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human\nright\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook\nsaid.\n\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally\nrequired to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while\nencouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for\nDACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to\nreceive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they\ngrew up after entering undocumented.\n\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love\nof their country and commitment to it.\"\n\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook\nsaid, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * Smart Phones\n  * Cloud Software\n  * Enterprise Applications\n\nBack to Top __\n\n## related stories\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\nDrybar’s Rise To Success With NetSuite Has A Hidden Message For Partners\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n‘Unmistakable Bias’: AWS Challenges Microsoft’s JEDI Cloud Win\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n10 Emerging Cloud Computing Trends To Watch In 2020\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n5 Key Announcements At Microsoft Ignite 2019\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\nRackspace Acquires Cloud-Native AWS Specialist Onica\n\n## trending stories\n\n  1. ###### Virtualization\n\nGartner’s Top 10 Technology Trends For 2020 That Will Shape The Future\n\n  2. ###### Internet of Things\n\n6 Emerging AI And Machine Learning Trends To Watch In 2020\n\n  3. ###### Components & Peripherals\n\nHere Is The ‘Strictly Confidential’ Xerox Offer That HP Rejected\n\n  4. ###### Security\n\nThe 10 Top News Stories Of 2019 (So Far)\n\n  5. ###### Data Center\n\nTop 12 Backup And Recovery Vendors: Gartner’s Magic Quadrant\n\n## Video\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlayNext playlist item\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently playing liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n1x\n\nChapters\n\n  * Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * captions and subtitles off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

One of\nAlibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\n\nThe Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-\nviolent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing\nin the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.\n\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s\ninitial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then\naccept the company’s unusual governance structure.\n\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many\nshares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can\nget, Reuters reported.\n\n  \n\n **Read more:** Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weigh\n\nHong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small\ninvestors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\n\nAlibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\nnext Tuesday.\n\n _Main image credit: Getty_\n\nShare\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  *   * __\n  * __\n\n  \n  \nTags: Alibaba  \n  \n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n## Related articles\n\n##  Alibaba’s secondary Hong Kong listing gets exchange approval\n\nAnna Menin\n\n##  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba eyes $15bn Hong Kong listing in boost for\ntroubled city\n\nJames Booth\n\n##  Alibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\nAnna Menin\n\n  * Business\n  * Industries\n  * Markets\n  * Technology\n  * Leadership\n  * Life & Style\n  * Money\n  * Sport\n\nFollow us for breaking news and latest updates:\n\n  *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\n  * Stay up to date:  \nSign up to our **daily newsletters**\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n    * Five at 5\n    * Midday Update\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Latest Edition\n\nCopyright © 2019 CityAM.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine\nproblems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of\nBoeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The\norder is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is\ntypically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have\nbeen badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet\nin less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of\nroughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to\nBiman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its\nlaunch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60\nof the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress,\nKazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference\nthat the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will\nrecommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of\nconsolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates\nfleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In\naddition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50\nAirbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The\nA350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the\nFrench plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-\nbody A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest\nairliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of\nthe jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would\nscrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the\nindustry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more\nfuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Transportation\n  * Travel\n  * Emerging markets\n  * Trade\n  * Airbus Group SE\n\nRelated\n\n  1.

The\nprotests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation\nthat would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland.\nAlthough the bill was withdrawn, the protests had broadened into a resistance\nmovement against the territory’s government and Beijing.\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Hong Kong uprising: Protestors send defiant warning to China\n  * Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nMany of the protesters wear masks to shield their identities for protection.\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain accused the UK and the US of meddling in the\ncountry’s affairs and warned that the Chinese government “will not sit on our\nhands” if the Hong Kong situation “becomes uncontrollable”.\n\nCheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, said: “These rioters,\nthey are also criminals. They have to face the consequences of their acts.\n\nChina has warned they will cease control of Hong Kong (Image: GETTY )\n\nThe protests kicked off in June and have strengthened in size (Image: GETTY )\n\n“Other than coming out to surrender, I don’t see that there’s any viable\noption for them.”\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaming has said that China has the\n“resolution and power” to end Hong Kong unrest amid protests.\n\nLiu said that the People’s Liberation Army could be deployed in Beijing,\nwarning: “They are already there in the Hong Kong garrison.

Retherford/SWRI)\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed\nseem to be real.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such _plumes\nemanating from Europa_, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath\nits ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor\ndirectly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus\nand sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are\nfound all over _the solar system_. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat\nhard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary\nscientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and\nAmerican University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the\nnext best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\n **Related:** _ **Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images**_\n\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study\nthe 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as\none of the solar system's _best bets to host alien life_.\n\nThe researchers observed _Europa_ for 17 nights, from February 2016 through\nMay 2017. On one of those nights — April 26, 2016 — they got a strong signal\nof water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared\nlight.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff — about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons),\naccording to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an\nOlympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric\ntons, of water).\n\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be\ncoming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's\nshell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted\nto result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules\nfrom Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such\nstripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be\nnoted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in _the new\npaper_, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature\nAstronomy.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For\nexample, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic\nhydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by\nradiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe _measured a big increase_ in the\ndensity of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In\nthat regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the\nsouth pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon _Enceladus_, which is\ngenerated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct\ndetection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits\nof our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to\nastrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially\nhabitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic\nprobes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just\nthat, if everything works out just right.\n\nNASA is developing a mission called _Europa Clipper_, which is scheduled to\nlaunch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close\non dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for\nspots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future.\nClipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys,\nif mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years —\nor if they just get really lucky.\n\n  * _NASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life_\n  *  _Photos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter_\n  *  _Keck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea_\n\n _Mike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"_ _ _Out There__ _\"\n(Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by_ __Karl Tate__ _), is out now.\nFollow him on Twitter_ _ _@michaeldwall__ _.

In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said\nhe pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a\nlittle and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases.\n\n“My people had $20 billion done,” Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet\nmeeting. “And I said, ‘I want more.’ They said, ‘The farmers can’t handle it.’\nI said, ‘Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very simple.’” The cabinet\nmembers gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks\nwith China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has\nalternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of\nthe insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even\nbigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history,\nMr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for.\nInstead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even\nharder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic\nuncertainty across the globe.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had\nreached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has\nproved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an\nagreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr.\nTrump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal\nand if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be\nremoved.\n\n“We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr. Trump\nsaid on Nov. 8. “I like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much\nmore than I do, but we could have a deal.”\n\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows\nhim to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic\ncriticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged\nfinancial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms\nthat rely on robust trade flows between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some\nhiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by\nunforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly\nmanufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese\neconomic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while\nGermany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n“It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions\nare threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams, the president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. “The\nuncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on\nthe economic conditions we’re experiencing today.”\n\nMr. Trump’s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected\nsimilar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan,\nCanada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he\nmight leave some trading partners behind.\n\nThe president says his approach has created leverage — and in some cases, he\nis right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada,\nJapan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed\nto. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the\nUnited States, to the negotiating table.\n\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a\nclose. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China\nwary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people\nfamiliar with Chinese trade policy said.\n\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president’s “mercurial\ntemperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team” had\ncomplicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. “By hyping up\nexpectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes\nthe prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and\nvolatile,” he said.\n\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and\nhis Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of\ndomestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take\nplace in United States “farm country,” but the Chinese have been reluctant to\ncommit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure\nto get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president’s\nunpredictable behavior — as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-\nprofile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.\nThey fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they\nanticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people\nfamiliar with their thinking.\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the\nonly president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and\nthat the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China\nhas long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump’s efforts\nto remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged\nAmerican firms operating in China.\n\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated\ntensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack\nof resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the\nadministration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and\nleaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its\nindustry, for later talks.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on\ncertainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of\nproducts that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China\ntrade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the\nTrump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of\ngoods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect — or\nwhether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would\nremain.\n\n“It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said Phil Levy,\nthe chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for\ncompanies. “It really doesn’t fit well with the world of global supply chains.\nAnd we’re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\n**”**\n\nEven Mr. Trump’s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration\nwith his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the\npresident doesn’t want the show to end.\n\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the\nAmerican Farm Bureau, said farmers faced “near-unprecedented economic\nuncertainty and hardship” stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and\nother key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible,\nsaying “time is running out for many in agriculture.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal,\nincluding securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month.\nAmerican negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the\nmassive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger purchases “than any time in our\nhistory, by far” — into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork,\nit has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it\nfavors American products over other countries’, as well as agreements that\ncould result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy\nand genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the\ncalculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could\nincrease its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a\nyear, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his\nadministration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies\nwill be removed if a deal is reached.\n\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval\nOffice with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an\nincrease in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back\nany levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been\nunder pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United\nStates.\n\n“Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not\nraising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive\nof implementing this deal on the Chinese part?” He Jianxiong, the former\nexecutive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a\nNov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\n\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\nGo to Home Page »\n\nnews\n\n  * home page\n  * world\n  * U.S.\n  * politics\n  * Election 2020\n  * New York\n  * business\n  * tech\n  * science\n  * climate\n  * sports\n  * obituaries\n  * the upshot\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n  * today's paper\n  * corrections\n\nopinion\n\n  * today's opinion\n  * op-ed columnists\n  * editorials\n  * op-ed Contributors\n  * letters\n  * sunday review\n  * video: opinion\n\narts\n\n  * today's arts\n  * art & design\n  * books\n  * dance\n  * movies\n  * music\n  * Pop Culture\n  * television\n  * theater\n  * watching\n  * video: arts\n\nliving\n\n  * automobiles\n  * Cooking\n  * crossword\n  * education\n  * food\n  * health\n  * jobs\n  * magazine\n  * parenting\n  * real estate\n  * style\n  * t magazine\n  * travel\n  * love\n\nlistings & more\n\n  * Reader Center\n  * Wirecutter\n  * Live Events\n  * The Learning Network\n  * tools & services\n  * N.Y.C. events guide\n  * multimedia\n  * photography\n  * video\n  * Newsletters\n  * NYT store\n  * times journeys\n  * manage my account\n\n### news\n\n  * home page\n  * world\n  * U.S.\n  * politics\n  * Election 2020\n  * New York\n  * business\n  * tech\n  * science\n  * climate\n  * sports\n  * obituaries\n  * the upshot\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n  * today's paper\n  * corrections\n\n### opinion\n\n  * today's opinion\n  * op-ed columnists\n  * editorials\n  * op-ed Contributors\n  * letters\n  * sunday review\n  * video: opinion\n\n### arts\n\n  * today's arts\n  * art & design\n  * books\n  * dance\n  * movies\n  * music\n  * Pop Culture\n  * television\n  * theater\n  * watching\n  * video: arts\n\n### living\n\n  * automobiles\n  * Cooking\n  * crossword\n  * education\n  * food\n  * health\n  * jobs\n  * magazine\n  * parenting\n  * real estate\n  * style\n  * t magazine\n  * travel\n  * love\n\n### more\n\n  * Reader Center\n  * Wirecutter\n  * Live Events\n  * The Learning Network\n  * tools & services\n  * N.Y.C. events guide\n  * multimedia\n  * photography\n  * video\n  * Newsletters\n  * NYT store\n  * times journeys\n  * manage my account\n\n### Subscribe\n\n  * home delivery\n  * digital subscriptions\n  * Crossword\n  * Cooking\n\n  * email newsletters\n  * corporate subscriptions\n  * education rate\n\n  * mobile applications\n  * replica edition\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * © 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Work with us\n  * Advertise\n  * T Brand Studio\n  * Your Ad Choices\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Terms of Sale\n  * Site Map\n  * Help\n  * Subscriptions\n\n"

Abrams. Abrams was a producer on _Star\nTrek Beyond_ , and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth\nfilm.\n\n\"This will be Hawley’s second film\"\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris\nHemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George\nKirk, the father of Chris Pine’s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years\nis a long time, and actors’ schedules shift. It’s unclear whether Hawley’s\nfilm is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return — both\nHemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018,\naccording to _The_ _Hollywood Reporter_. _The Wrap’s_ report today claims that\nPine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe\nSaldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn’t mention Hemsworth.\n\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth _Trek_ film,\naccording to _The Wrap_ , so it’s possible Paramount is still deciding on a\ndirection. As if things weren’t murky enough, _Deadline_ reports that\nParamount is also still working on a second, R-rated _Star Trek_ spin-off from\nQuentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ movie will be Hawley’s second film. _Lucy in the Sky,_\nhis debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing\nwith life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics — and flopped at\nthe box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box\nOffice Mojo.\n\nNo release date for the fourth _Star Trek_ film has yet been announced.\n\n##  Next Up In Tech\n\n###  Good Deals\n\n  1.

World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli Settlements Illegal \n\n# World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli\nSettlements Illegal\n\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:29 GMT\n\nA man rides on a donkey in the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares opposite the\nIsraeli Jewish settlement of Revava (background) on November 19, 2019. Israeli\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer\nconsiders settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but\nthe Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\n\nHighlights\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\n**The United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on\nTuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal,\nwhile the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.**\n\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change\nthe reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned\nthe unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\"\nby the announcement.\n\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the\nestablishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international\nlaw\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the\ninternational community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring\nsettlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did\n\"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the\nInternational Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of\nJerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the\nState of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic\ninjustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West\nBank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future\nPalestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's\nadministration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as\nIsrael's capital.\n\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off\npotential legal moves against Israel.\n\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the\nTrump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called\nfor an emergency meeting of the body.\n\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and\nJordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign\nMinister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of\nmeasures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial\ninvestigation,\" he added.\n\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to\nvarying degrees.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure\ncontradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely\nfurther heighten tensions on the ground.\n\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to\nencourage... settlement building\".\n\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position\nthat settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to\npeace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context\nfor a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify\nproducts made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the\ncoming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing\nconstituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of\nWest Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an\ninternational consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said\nAvi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the\nPalestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally,\nexternally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will\nstand tall.\"\n\n_This article has been adapted from its original source._\n\nVia SyndiGate.info  \n\n  \n\nCopyright @ 2019 The New Arab.\n\n## You may also like\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n## You may also like\n\n####  Subscribe\n\nSign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n####  Subscribe\n\nSign up to get Al Bawaba's exclusive celeb scoops and entertainment news\n\n  \n\n  * Latest\n  * Popular\n\n###  US: Top 100 Brands Are Worth More Than the GDP of Germany\n\n###  Dubai’s Non-Oil Trade with Africa to Exceed $272 Billion\n\n###  Next Khashoggi?

To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this\nparticular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love\nExperience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has\nbeen a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the\npast six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that\nchange has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to\nwork as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry.\nAlso, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and\nevery day!\n\n#### **Q: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the\nmost helpful as CEO?**\n\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a\nperson is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add\nbeing comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You\nmust be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a\nrapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent\ncomplete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that\nreality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\n\n#### **Q: How do you prioritize your day?**\n\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits\nof Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things\nfirst”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the\ntop of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller\nitems on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for\nemails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at\nhand.\n\n> The best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our\n> outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either. Our\n> employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them\n> every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry.\n> Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things\n> with us, which is priceless.\n\n#### **Q: What’s on the horizon for the business?**\n\nA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to\nconsumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a\nflat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a\ndedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section\njust for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the\nindustry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new\nway to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to\ntarget fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more\nintelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the\ntechnology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t\nwait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\n\n#### **Q: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the\nmost?**\n\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the\nbusiness each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the\nnumber of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships\nregularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but\nthe need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees,\nclients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct\napproach.\n\n#### **Q: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you’ve been\nnamed a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What’s it like to be\nnamed a 40 Under 40?**\n\nA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It’s a very\nprestigious group of folks this year – and in years past – and I am so\nappreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I\nwork with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I\nshare this recognition with the entire Experience team.\n\nOk, now for a little fun.\n\n#### **Q: Where did you grow up?**\n\nA: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands – the most beautiful 87 square miles\nin the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\n\n#### **Q: Favorite childhood memory?**\n\nA: Trip to Disney World\n\n#### **Q: Favorite apps?**\n\nA: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile\n\n#### **Q: Favorite artists or groups?**\n\nA: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\n\n#### **Q: Favorite books?**\n\nA: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\n\n#### **Q: Favorite live event you’ve ever attended?**\n\nA: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record\nbreaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely\nrocking!\n\n#### **Q: Favorite athlete?**\n\nA: Lebron James\n\n#### **Q: Favorite places you have visited?**\n\nA: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\n\n#### **Q: Most memorable live event experience?**\n\nA: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50\nplus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma\nCity Thunder – AND, seeing Adele live in concert – she brought the house down!\n\n#### **Q: What are your hobbies?**\n\nA: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my\nfamily.\n\n#### **Q: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years**\n\nA: Sonos – Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your\nhouse with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it\nin an incredibly simple way.\n\nThanks Junior!\n\n« Previous Post Next Post »\n\n  * Categories: \n    * Fan Testimonial\n    * How To\n    * Opinions\n    * Partner Announcement\n    * Partner Success\n    * Press\n    * Pro Tips\n    * Research\n    * Solutions\n    * Spotlight\n    * Updates\n\n# Other pages\n\n## Experience\n\n  * Who We Are\n  * Our Team\n  * Work With Us\n  * Press/Media Center\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Mobile Commerce\n  * Ticketing Technology\n  * Data Solutions\n\n## Community\n\n  * Blog\n  * Engineering Blog\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\nOur mobile commerce, flexible ticket sales, and data solutions empower sports\nand entertainment leaders to generate new revenue streams, sell more tickets,\nand make smarter decisions.\n\nContact us 3535 Piedmont Rd NE #415 Atlanta, GA 30305\n\n© 2019 Experience\n\n"

The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is\nGoogle's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks\nin the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely\nhigh fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless\nexperience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device\nthey choose to play on.\n\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was\nannounced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed\nlast week), featuring popular franchises such as _Assassin's Creed, Tomb\nRaider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny_ and more. Notably, only one title at\nlaunch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works'\n_Gylt_ , while most of the other games offered have been on the market for\nmonths on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia\nthroughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm\nIDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly\nsubscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60\nframes per second and discounts on certain titles ( _Destiny 2_ is available\nfor free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for\nStadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the\ngames having been on the market for some time already.\n\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google’s planned\n'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the\nhole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming\ncommunity...and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and\nPro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games\ncatalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming\noptions out there.\"\n\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both\nof which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform),\nStadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an\nextension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early,\nsenior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by\nletting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-\nTwo, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader\ndistribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the\nopportunity and we’ll see how it goes.\"\n\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the\nindustry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not\nthe only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony\nNow service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project\nxCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with\nplans for its full launch set for next year.\n\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these\nservices in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\"\nWard says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by\nseveral of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with\nadequate bandwidth or you’re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York,\nbandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still\nsays Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the\nindustry.\n\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having\nan experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist\ntoday. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will\nbreak the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\n\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only\nthree games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early\nsays there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and\nlaunched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best\ngame and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the\ninteresting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be\nrun in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not\nbe that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a\ncloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become\nsomething we'd look at.\"\n\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also\nstepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade\nsubscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was\nthe list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering,\nall of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out\neach week.\n\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches\nnext year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says\nWard.\n\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the\nfuture of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early\ngoing. \"This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he\nsays. \"You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re\nalready used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet.\nIt’s tough to go back to console.\"\n\n  * FACEBOOK\n  * TWITTER\n  * EMAIL ME\n\n  * Patrick Shanley\n\npatrick.shanley@THR.com @pshanley88\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\n© 2019 The Hollywood Reporter  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy | Sitemap | About Our Ads\n\n  * About Us\n  * Daily Edition\n  * Subscribe\n  * Subscriber Services\n  * Back Issues\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact Us\n  * Tipline\n  * Careers\n  * Industry Jobs\n\n  * Follow Us On Twitter\n  * Find Us On Facebook\n  * Watch Us On Youtube\n\nOur affiliate publications\n\n  * Billboard\n  * Vibe\n  * Spin\n  * Stereogum\n\nCookie Settings\n\n"

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as\nReed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the\nlargest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news\norganizations.\n\n> Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper\n> industry as a whole.\n\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of\nlocal news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and\nmanagements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough\nto take up the slack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast\nmajority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that\ndigital advertisers don’t much care for.\n\n“Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper\nindustry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s\nproduced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in\nlocal news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media\ncompanies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said\nthat he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the\ncombination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the\nworkforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60\nemployees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it\n“immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in\nnewspapers — for plundering\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in\nnewspapers — for plundering\n\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society — especially\nlocal journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians’ hands out of the\npublic cookie jar — Alden Global Capital is a “vulture investing” firm that\nmakes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register,\nDenver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and\nboasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the\npublicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources —\nwith good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about\ntwice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of\nTribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake\nheld by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9\nmillion.)\n\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t\nescape the industry’s economic challenges.\n\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento\nBee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news\nindustry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue\nof $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss\nreflected a write-down of the company’s news assets.\n\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million.\nMcClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or\ncash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its\npension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by\nthe government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nMcClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In\nDecember, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago\nTribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the\nformer owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly\ndemanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\n\nBusiness\n\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n\nBusiness\n\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n\nThe owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board,\nbut it’s still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some\nshareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\n\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-\nmarket publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro\nnewspapers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having\npaid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-\nShiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500\nmillion. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major\nshareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune.\nBoth companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation\nin the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as\nAlden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any\nsavings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future,\nthe imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the\nnews audience has been moving to.\n\nGateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by\nPenelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s\npractice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and\npage design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty\nreporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-\nowned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy\nreported.\n\nReed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media,\nthe GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to\nquickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through\ndividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It\nshouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to\npay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\n\nBusiness\n\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n\nBusiness\n\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n\nFreelance writers and photographers fear California’s new gig worker law will\nmake them unemployable.\n\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of\nplunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress\nInvestment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as\na major player in the company through an initial public offering and a\nbankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will\nleave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an\ninvestor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They\nbrought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re\ngoing to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t\neven take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the\nbillionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her\nproposal for a wealth tax.)\n\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that\nremains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial\nplayers like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,”\nsays Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”\n\nIn the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public\ncompanies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have\nimposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on\nphysical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all\nits newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles\nonline. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other\nnational-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace —\nthose companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital\nnews requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says,\nthey’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate\ndestination remains unclear.\n\n“After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going\nto be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital\nsubscription? What’s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?”\n\n* * *\n\nBusiness\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet our weekly California Inc. newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nMichael Hiltzik\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * email\n  * facebook\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael Hiltzik writes a daily blog\nappearing on latimes.com.

Advice\n\n# Dear Abby: Husband springs for business class flight to India, but leaves\nwife in economy seat\n\nToday 12:01 AM\n\nBy  Abigail Van Buren\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to\nIndia. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in\nbusiness class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply\ndoesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility\nissues.\n\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than\nhis love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful\ncountry? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a\nbeautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your\npenny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you\nthan he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You\nhave a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either\nsit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a\nrestaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was\nwashing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my\nface and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out\nof the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling\nme no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said\nthat I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer\nthe texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she\nbelieves the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t\ncare. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was\ntempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges.\nShould I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have\nwritten, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and\nfalsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to\nan emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about\nwhat the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The\nHPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our\ngeneration.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if\nher granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had\nasked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have\ngrandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. --\nCONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t\nthink your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was\nasked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that\nher granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually\nactive, which made her defensive.\n\n _Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips,\nand was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

And, thanks to your reports about\nthem, I can quickly fix it.\n\nSo, if you notice that some game mechanics are working incorrectly, or some\nevent used to work before, and now you cannot start it, or even you just\ncannot press some button, spend a minute of time and write about it in the\nbug-tracker. In such way you can help make my games better.\n\n  * __Facebook\n  * __Twitter\n  * __Email\n  * __Pinterest\n  * __LinkedIn\n  * __Odnoklassniki\n  * __WhatsApp\n  * __VKontakte\n  * __Telegram\n\n  * __Facebook\n  * __Twitter\n  * __Email\n  * __Pinterest\n  * __LinkedIn\n  * __Odnoklassniki\n  * __WhatsApp\n  * __VKontakte\n  * __Telegram\n\nPrevious Post\n\nNext Post\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nClose\n\n##### Author’s column\n\n  * Upcoming Hero’s Base updates\n\nSometimes people ask me why this or that location become […]\n\n  * Last Man: Skills system update\n\nI want to tell you about another important change in Last Man, […]\n\n  * Bonuses of May\n\nI haven’t written anything for a long time in the author’s […]\n\n  * 100% Walkthrough\n\nThis is a hidden post for club members.

Kristi NoemKristi Lynn NoemSouth Dakota governor doubles\ndown on 'meth, we're on it' anti-drug campaign  South Dakota drops pipeline\nprotest laws after lawsuit New South Dakota law requiring 'In God We Trust'\nsign to hang in public schools goes into effect MORE (R) is defending the\nstate’s launch of an anti-drug campaign with the slogan “Meth, we’re on it.”\n\nThe tagline drew a mix of criticism and ridicule across Twitter on Monday, but\nNoem cited the backlash as proof that efforts to raise awareness around South\nDakota's methamphetamine crisis was, in fact, working.\n\n“Meth is IN SD. Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it -\nMeth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,” Noem tweeted\nMonday night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoem later tweeted that the state’s meth epidemic “needs to be a dinner table\nconversation,” adding “we need everyone on it.”\n\nThe campaign, which includes both digital and TV ads, cost the state roughly\n$449,000, according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n\nOne campaign video featured a series of South Dakotans — including both adults\nand children — declaring, “I’m on meth.” The video, as well as photos of\npeople with the tagline, prompted some Twitter users to argue that the\npromotional material made it look as if those featured in the campaign were on\nthe drug themselves.\n\n“South Dakota: if we were any higher, we’d be North Dakota,” one user quipped.\n\nAnother wondered why the state bothered to trademark the tagline in the first\nplace.\n\n> I love that they trademarked it. Don't worry, South Dakota, no one's going\n> to take your slogan. https://t.co/XPxUJuyIAC\n>\n> — Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) November 18, 2019\n\nThe latest initiative comes as the state struggles to address its growing rate\nof methamphetamine use in recent years, particularly among its youth.\n\nIn 2016, the South Dakota's Department of Social Services reported that the\nnumber of young people in the state who have reported using meth was 3.8\npercent, compared to the national average of 3 percent.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse has also estimated that 964,000 people\nage 12 and older, which account for about 0.4 percent of the total U.S.\npopulation, reported a methamphetamine use disorder in 2017, marking a\nsignificant increase from the previous year.\n\nThe governor's office didn't immediately respond to The Hill's request for\ncomment.\n\nTags Kristi Noem South Dakota\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n## Most Popular\n\n## Video\n\nKrystal Ball issues warning to Biden supporters\n\nRising\n\nMost GOP voters say adoption agencies shouldn't be allowed to refuse same-sex\ncouples\n\nRising\n\nSanders official predicts health care, climate change will be top issues in\nfifth Democratic debate\n\nRising\n\nBernie surrogate: Moderate candidates more frightened by Sanders than Trump\n\nRising\n\n## More From The Web\n\nDon't miss a brief.

The Dark Enchantment of Carmen Maria Machado’s Memoir, _In the Dream House_\n\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a\nquest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The\nbook was called _The Dragon Waiting_ , and it was written by the late science\nfiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market\npaperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical\nfervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford’s\nobscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one\nof them.\n\n_The Dragon Waiting_ is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before\nGeorge R.R. Martin wrote _A Song of Ice and Fire_ , Ford created an alternate-\nhistory retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark\nmagic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy.\n_The Dragon Waiting_ provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of\nGene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ****\nensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with\nanother.\n\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of\nthis mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It’s\ncurrently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not\navailable at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into\nthis level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford’s career, the more\nfrustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had\nwon the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a\nbeloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton,\nEllen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and\nDaniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn’t anyone\npublishing his books?\n\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to\nthe vast treasure trove of Ford’s uncollected and unpublished writing. It\nwould introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn’t spoken to each\nother since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John\nM. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed\nrepublication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen?\nMore importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly\nthan that: How did he write those amazing books?\n\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago,\nIndiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane\nStarner, “He was brilliant from the start—reading at an adult level when he\nwas in kindergarten and talking to college students.” He played chess and\nloved model trains. But he was also sickly—after nearly falling into a coma at\nthe age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana\nUniversity, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and\namassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two\nyears, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first\nnovel, _Web of Angels_ , __ a cyberpunk book before the term was invented.\nPocket published it in 1980.*\n\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some\nbeast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs,\nguarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is\nmade up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often\nthan not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. “When\nyou’re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,” said Beth Meacham,\none of his editors at Tor. “Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And\nthe play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple\nmeanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.”\n\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will\nbe utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital\nconnections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading,\nand faith that the author knows what he’s doing are essential for navigating\nthese moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the\nnovelist Jo Walton explained them to me. “You’re only seeing the tenth of the\niceberg that’s out of the water in every novel,” she said. “It makes it dense\nin a really _powerful_ way, but sometimes it’s too hard for people because he\nwouldn’t spell things out.” When his editors would ask him to explain himself\nmore, he’d respond, “I have a horror of being obvious.”\n\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people,\nand real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes,\nnor do they always understand what’s going on, particularly if they lack\npower, as Ford’s characters often do. If there’s one unifying theme to his\nbooks, it’s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In _The Dragon Waiting_\n, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed\nwith guilt after committing her first murder. _The Last Hot Time_ , an urban\nfantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own\ndesire to be a dom in bed. _Growing Up Weightless_ , a story of political\nintrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their\nchildren.\n\n“Had he taken _The Dragon Waiting_ and written a sequence of five books based\nin that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” — Neil\nGaiman\n\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill\nvolumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show\ncalled “Ask Dr. Mike” at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted\nout absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote\nhandbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the\nmaps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including _The Eye of the\nWorld_ , the first book in Robert Jordan’s _Wheel of Time_ series. His blog\ncomments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King\nEdward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his\nChristmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or\nshort satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every\nyear during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called “Winter Solstice,\nCamelot Station _,”_ went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it\nhere.)\n\n“He would make art in the most surprising places,” Gaiman told me. “Once he\nwrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy\nFawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.”\nWhen Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he\nwould scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them\nfor her to find. “Life was not long enough,” she recalled, “for Mike to do all\nthe stuff that he would think of to do.”\n\n“He could have had a more successful career,” Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa’s\nhusband and Tor’s editor in chief, said, “if he had been more disciplined\nabout his writing” and stuck to one genre, or written a series. “But Mike\nwanted to write what he wanted to write.”\n\nNo single example illustrates this better than _The Dragon Waiting_ and its\naftermath. As Gaiman put it, “Had he taken _The Dragon Waiting_ and written a\nsequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been\nGeorge R.R. Martin.” Ford opted instead to write two _Star Trek_ novels ( _The\nFinal Reflection_ and _How Much for Just the Planet?_, both unexpected\ndelights) and _The Scholars of Night_ , a riff on midcentury British espionage\nthrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at\nits center. Gaiman still bemoans that _The Scholars of Night “_ should’ve been\nmarketed like _The Name of the Rose_. __ You needed to go, `We have a great\nwriter who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines\nhigh and low culture.’ ” Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St.\nMartin’s, published _Scholars_ with a blank back cover. It didn’t exactly do\nUmberto Eco–level business.\n\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002.\n\nPhoto by David Dyer-Bennet\n\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack\nof insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. “All it took\nwas one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,” Teresa\nNielsen Hayden explained. “To be an adult about money would mean to be\npermanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the\nthings that made his life so much better. And so he didn’t.”\n\nTo the extent that Ford’s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare,\na health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a\nkidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made\npossible by the doctor’s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent\nthat his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends,\nparticularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited _The Scholars of Night_ , and her\nhusband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired\nFord to work as a “games consultant” for the _Wheel of Time_ series, mostly to\nhelp keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford\nas his “blood brother,” had essentially adopted him.\n\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family.\nThe causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his\nmother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner\nsays that Ford’s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford’s\nattitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God\ncheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue\nwas Ford’s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\n\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had\nbeen married for two years when she and Mike began dating. “My partner to whom\nI am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle\ninitial M,” Matthesen recalled in an email. “I used to refer to them\ncollectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.”\n\n“The thing with Elise bothered” Ford’s family, Starner said. “I don’t know\nwhether they were completely estranged before that or not.” But either way, at\nsome point, Ford’s now-deceased father told Starner that “the only way I know\nhe’s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.”\n\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words\nlong, titled _Aspects_. Beth Meacham described it as “a magical-parliamentary-\nnobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.” When he’d finish\nchunks of it, he’d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton,\nand Meacham. They were all amazed by it. __\n\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he\nstruggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard\nit was to weave action into some parts of the story. “It’s not exactly like I\ncan have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,” he wrote.\nThen, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so\ndelighted his friends:\n\n> If a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is\n> a high fantasy.\n>\n> If he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by\n> a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\n>\n> If he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great\n> emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he\n> leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker __ story.\n\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He\nwas heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise\nMatthesen found him. “He looked a little surprised,” she wrote in an email.\n“Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.”\nAlthough he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was\ntherefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had\n“married,” but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (“The\nKlingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,” was how\nFord described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford’s\nfamily, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford’s passing. She would\nhave one phone conversation with Ford’s mother. After that, everything would\nbe done through lawyers.\n\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006,\nFord’s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his\nestate. But the document had been left in Ford’s apartment, which she could no\nlonger legally access. Matthesen and Ford’s friends wanted some say in the\ndisposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel\nwere unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford’s body, cleaned out his apartment,\nand, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own\nmemorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford’s\nimmediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but\nbitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit\nFord’s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\n\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only _The Last Hot Time_ ,\nthe story collection _Heat of Fusion_, __ and the two _Star Trek_ novels\nremained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his\nmajor works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished _Aspects,_ had\nreverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford’s family. No\none had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal,\nand Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford’s literary estate and set up\na foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story,\nrepeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford’s\nfamily did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of\nprint. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them\nfor comment on this article.\n\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement\ncommunity in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late\nnephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the\nfamily. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece\nwere suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford’s sister,\nMartha Fry. “I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print\n**,”** she said.\n\nAll contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice\ndissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\n\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they\ncould do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of\nthat interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or\nhis parents, saying instead he was “introverted by nature.” “I once visited\nMike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,” Dale wrote. “We went\nto an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. …\nOur parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We\nfound some of the opened letters among his belongings.” Martha added that\nshortly before their father’s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the\nletter Mike wrote was “kind and loving.”\n\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike’s relationship with\nElise. “Mike’s personal life was his own business and did not affect our\nfeelings for him as a family,” Dale wrote. “I am appreciative to [Elise] for\nfinding Mike’s body and calling the police. … Martha read a copy of the police\nreport, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as ‘friend,’ not a legal\nspouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike\nfound caring friends during his adult life.”\n\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple\nfriends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote\nback, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that.\nFord and Fry replied that I was threatening them with “the unsubstantiated\nbeliefs of uncited individuals … if we do not respond to your satisfaction on\nMike’s commercial affairs.” However, they volunteered that on three separate\noccasions they had written to Mike’s agent, trying to see if there was any\ninterest in reprinting his work. When they didn’t hear back, they assumed\nthere wasn’t.\n\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford\nand wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal.\nWas it really possible, I asked Ford’s friends, that his agent could have\nignored his family’s requests?\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford’s agent had dropped out of\nthe industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick\nNielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford’s death, his agent Valerie Smith “was\nbeginning the process of essentially vanishing” from the industry. She “became\nmore and more intermittent” with phone calls and correspondence, and many of\nher clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her\nin a decade.\n\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone. Smith still\nfound it difficult to talk about Mike Ford’s death and the events surrounding\nit. She had represented him since 1978. _Web of Angels_ was the first novel\nshe ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal\nbattle unrelated to her literary work left her “pretty overwhelmed,” she said.\nHer heartbreak over Mike Ford’s death, an event that still leaves her angry\ntoday, helped push her further out of the industry. “When I started, I really\nfelt like this was where I was meant to be,” she said. “I just can’t bring\nmyself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.” Smith said\nshe never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike\nFord’s work.\n\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage,\nseeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths\nremained obscure. I do not share Ford’s horror at obviousness, but there are\nsimply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his\nfamily grew apart, or, from the family’s perspective, how far apart they were.\nWe will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out\nElise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\n\nBut I reconnected Ford’s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of\ndelicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have\nreached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into\nprint, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other\nuncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me\nto Ford, _The Dragon Waiting_. __ Then, in 2021, Tor will publish—at long\nlast—the unfinished _Aspects_ , with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\n\nAs in one of John M. Ford’s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached.\nIt’s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It’s not one that ties\nup every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that\nhappen. But the ending they’ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and\nleaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\n\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of\nElise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford’s work, still smarting\nfrom the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\n“I don’t even have words, it’s such good news,” she replied in an email.\n“Except maybe Mike’s words.”\n\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a\nprompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: _I’m going to die. Tell\nme a story_.\n\n“No,” he said. “No. You tell me one, and when you’re gone, I’ll tell it to\nsomebody else.”\n\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first\npublisher of John M. Ford’s novel _Web of Angels_.

Click here to support it.\n\n__\n\n### Origin\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2019, former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\ntestified before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment\ninquiry against President Donald Trump. Shortly after, some of Trump’s\ndefenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming\nthat the ambassador’s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because\nof some illicit means:\n\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found\nthat this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such\nas Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no\nevidence. Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her\npart, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her\nalleged fortune.\n\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\n\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17\nmillion, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net\nworth:\n\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is\nno credible evidence for the estimates.\n\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and\nGossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded\nher salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered\nno evidence to support their estimates.\n\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical\ninformation about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however,\nprovide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch\nmay have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead,\nthey simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making\nany attempt to justify that figure.\n\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they\narrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information\nbecomes available.\n\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12\nmillion or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor\nappears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to\ndiscredit her U.S. House testimony.\n\nSnopes.com\n\nSince 1994\n\n##### A Word to Our Loyal Readers\n\nSupport Snopes and make a difference for readers everywhere.\n\nRead the Letter __\n\n##### Editorial\n\n  * David Mikkelson\n  * Doreen Marchionni\n  * David Emery\n  * Bond Huberman\n  * Jordan Liles\n  * Alex Kasprak\n  * Dan Evon\n  * Dan MacGuill\n  * Bethania Palma\n  * Liz Donaldson\n\n##### Operations\n\n  * Vinny Green\n  * Ryan Miller\n  * Chris Reilly\n  * Chad Ort\n  * Elyssa Young\n\nMost Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?” Those tips\nlaunch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of political,\nscientific, legal, historical, and visual information.

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been\nrallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with\nmacroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three\npositive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed\ndivestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-\nChina trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we\nexpect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL\nSecurities.\n\nClose\n\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a\nrecovery in the economy.\n\n## related news\n\n  * ### FIIs bullish on India, growth should start accelerating in Q2CY20, says Ridham Desai\n\n  * ### Taking Stock: Historic day on D-St! Here's what is driving the rally\n\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a\nreasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak\nInstitutional Equities.\n\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of\nthe companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The\nkey positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front\n(sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely\nneutral, say experts.\n\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate\ntax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental\nResearch at Kotak Securities.\n\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the\nconcerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza\nattributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar\nSteel resolution.\n\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should\nbe seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in\nbidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will\nbe high now,\" said Oza.\n\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the\nEssar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured\nbanks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\n\n **Near-term consolidation likely**  \n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't\ngrow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as\ndistorted by a misconception.\"\n\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings\nshould not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several\nstructural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or\ninvestment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the\nhigh government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent\nrevival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the\nmarket and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is\na stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the\nbenchmark.\n\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far,\nit looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\nThe Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of\nfactors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a\nChina-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's\nexpectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the\nmarket’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and\nstrong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional\nEquities said.\n\n _ **Disclaimer:** The views and investment tips expressed by investment\nexperts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its\nmanagement.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed\nthree Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in\nstalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul\ngovernment and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s\n18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US\ntroops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the\nTaliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla\ninsurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a\npolitical office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us\nhope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United\nStates stands ready to support.\n\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible\nand costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a\npolitical settlement.”\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their\nordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions,\nin the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last\nweek, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to\nthe front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct\ntalks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to\nnegotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are\nprofoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’\nfamily had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart\nof Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two\nvideos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale\nand gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their\ngovernments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether\nthey were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the\nhostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement\nfor US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal\nwhen President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n  * \n\nFiled under afghanistan ,  hostages ,  middle east ,  prisoners ,  taliban\n\n### Share this article:\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n  * \n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nShare Selection\n\n####  Trending Now on NYPost.com\n\n  1.

Lee  Senior Contributor\n\nOpinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\n\nHealthcare\n\nI am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and\ndigital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that\norder.\n\n  * Share to facebook __\n  * Share to twitter __\n  * Share to linkedin __\n\nHow can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils?\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it\nwas this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a\nserious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal\n_BMJ Case Reports_.\n\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and\neven eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may\nleave you breathless.\n\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris\nRuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary\nin the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November\n2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor\ninitially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but\ncontrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In\nfact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the\npoint where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of\nbreath.\n\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the\nonset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few\nminutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs\nto bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time\nasleep (day and night).”\n\nAt first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless.\nHe wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His\nmain hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated\nthat he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently\n“acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go\non, go on.\n\nBreathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much\nair as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well between\nhis lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\nA CT of his chest showed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some\nlymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were\nconsistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your\nlungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to\nbreathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird\ndroppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers.\nWhen the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather\nduvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird\nfancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called\n“pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken\ncostume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\nWait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s\ncalled “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier\nlung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some\nsimilar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub\nlung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs\ncan travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not\nalways good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic\nreaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo:\nGetty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm\nthe reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the\nfeather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling\nof mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect\nwithin 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the\nallergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.”\n\nEventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the course\nof steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in\ndose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen\nsaturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal\nfor someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It\ndoesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.”\n\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the\ninflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can\nresult. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible.\nNot surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe\nand exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life\nthreatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone you fancy, you\nmay want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic\nreaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap\nor anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the\nmany bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it’s the pigeons\nthat you are breeding in your kitchen.\n\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the\nflocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like\n“feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case\nbecame a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may\nhave seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the\nslightest touch and you feel weak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Funding for\nIncubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we\nwork closely.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\n  * Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More) \n  * Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More) \n  * Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More) \n\n### Incubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\n> A key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-\n> backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem\n> potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there\n> is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This\n> grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on\n> interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but\n> that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n>\n> We have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most\n> important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through\n> partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the\n> potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and\n> scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top\n> charities.\n>\n> We believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the\n> nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially\n> scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator\nbecause of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-\nquality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence\nAction, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No\nLean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\n#### Modeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made\nexplicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this\ngrant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this\nsection, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s\ncost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top\ncharities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than\nalternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\n  1. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or \n  2. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level. \n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders\nto allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may\ncreate programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If\nthese new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would\nhave otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by\ncausing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never\nrecommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not\nbecause we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and\ncommunicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a\n55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by\nDecember 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to\nwhich we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the\ngrant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts\nwe made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above\nin our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential\nupside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could\nchange substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as\ncash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly\nuncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-\neffectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-\neffective as cash transfers.\n\n### Risks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\n  * Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact. \n  * We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused. \n\n### Going forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we\nmight contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in\nthe future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing\npartnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\nPosted in GiveWell Incubation Grants | Permalink | 1 Comment\n\n  * Previous Post\n  * Next Post\n\n### Comments\n\n  * **Jamie Cassidy** on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said: \n\nI am so pumped about this!

The second-generation AirPods offer support for “Hey, Siri”\nand include Apple’s upgraded H1 chip for fast pairing. Great for a holiday\ngift this year or for yourself upgrading a mobile work setup. We loved them in\nour hands-on review.\n\n### Black Friday pricing live for ecobee\n\nBlack Friday pricing on ecobee’s latest SmartThermostat with Voice Control is\nnow live at Amazon for **$199**. Today’s deal is a $50 price break from the\nregular going rate and a return to the Amazon all-time low price. We’ve only\nseen it this low once before, back on Prime Day 2019. ecobee completely\nredesigned its new thermostat, now featuring a glass face and a “vivid” touch\ndisplay. You’ll still be able to count on HomeKit and Siri control, along with\nsupport for Alexa, Google Assistant, and other smart home mediums.

That’s $200 off the regular rate, more than a $147 savings\ncompared to Amazon’s current sale price, and happens to be a match for the\nlowest Amazon offer we can find. Apple’s latest iPad Pro features a Liquid\nRetina edge-to-edge display with ProMotion, True Tone, and wide color support.\nFace ID, a 12MP camera, and 10-hour battery life are also in tow, providing a\ntruly great tablet experience.\n\n### Eve Door & Window brings automations to your Siri setup\n\nAmazon is currently offering the Eve Door & Window HomeKit Entry Sensor for\n**$30**. Usually selling for $40, today’s offer is good for a 25% discount,\nmarks the first major price drop of the year, and is at a new Amazon all-time\nlow. Eve’s entry sensor works with HomeKit via Bluetooth and is a great way to\nenhance the functionality of your Siri-enabled setup.

The health commission said in a statement that a\n55-year old man had contracted bubonic plague after eating a wild rabbit\nduring a hunting trip. The man was subsequently quarantined after the\ndiagnosis, along with 28 people who he came into contact with.\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Plague outbreak: China hit by ‘highly contagious’ pneumonic plague\n  * Horror as plague of killer mosquitos are headed to Britain\n\nHowever, the other 28 people have showed no signs or symptoms of the plague.\n\nThe other two contractors caught pneumonic plague, with the difference being\nbubonic effects the lymph nodes whereas pneumonic effects the lungs.\n\nFan Mengguang, deputy director of Inner Mongolia’s disease prevention and\ncontrol centre, told the media that the latest case is “isolated and\nunrelated” to the cases in Beijing.\n\nHowever, with three confirmed diagnoses, the public is beginning to panic over\na potential outbreak.\n\nYersina pestis causes the plague (Image: GETTY)\n\nThe plague wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century (Image: GETTY)\n\nAccording to AFP, one user on Weibo, which is essentially China’s version of\nTwitter, posted: “I just want to know how these two came to Beijing?? By\ntrain, airplane, or did they drive themselves?”\n\nAnother reportedly said: ”Bird flu in the year of the rooster... swine fever\nin the year of the pig.

A\n43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling\nextreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet\nlung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained\nmalaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a\nlower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit\nafter that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days\noff work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness,\nsuch as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to\nbed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was\nsigned off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\n **Related:** _ **7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction**_\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be\nnormal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal\nInfirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed\nCT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic\nreaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather\nbedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a\ncompound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was\ndiagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung\ninflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the\nbody's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air\nsacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we\nrealize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of\nhypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust\nfrom hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is\nsawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic\nsynthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six\nmonths he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and\nhe is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\"\nthe patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\"\nof the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the\nenvironment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is\n\"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated\nunnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't\npanic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as\ncough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know,\nhe added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal _BMJ Case Reports_.\n\n  *  _27 Oddest Medical Case Reports_\n  *  _10 Strangest Medical Cases_\n  *  _11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed_\n\n _Originally published on_ _ _Live Science__ _._\n\n _Want more science?

By “tasting” the presence of certain pathogens, these\ncells may act as sentinels for the immune system.\n\nRenderBurger for Quanta Magazine\n\n### Carrie Arnold\n\n _Contributing Writer_\n\n* * *\n\n _November 15, 2019_\n\n* * *\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunology\n\nWhen the immunologist De’Broski Herbert at the University of Pennsylvania\nlooked deep inside the lungs of mice infected with influenza, he thought he\nwas seeing things. He had found a strange-looking cell with a distinctive\nthatch of projections like dreadlocks atop a pear-shaped body, and it was\nstudded with taste receptors. He recalled that it looked just like a tuft cell\n— a cell type most often associated with the lining of the intestines.\n\nBut what would a cell covered with taste receptors be doing in the lungs? And\nwhy did it only appear there in response to a severe bout of influenza?\n\nHerbert wasn’t alone in his puzzlement over this mysterious and little-studied\ngroup of cells that keep turning up in unexpected places, from the thymus (a\nsmall gland in the chest where pathogen-fighting T cells mature) to the\npancreas. Scientists are only just beginning to understand them, but it is\ngradually becoming clear that tuft cells are an important hub for the body’s\ndefenses precisely because they can communicate with the immune system and\nother sets of tissues, and because their taste receptors allow them to\nidentify threats that are still invisible to other immune cells.\n\nResearchers around the world are tracing the ancient evolutionary roots that\nolfactory and taste receptors (collectively called chemosensory receptors or\nnutrient receptors) share with the immune system. A flurry of work in recent\nyears shows that their paths cross far more often than anyone anticipated, and\nthat this chemosensory-immunological network plays a role not just in\ninfection, but in cancer and at least a handful of other diseases.\n\nThis system, says Richard Locksley, an immunologist at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, helps direct a systematic response to potential\ndangers throughout the body. Research focusing on the interactions of the tuft\ncell could offer a glimpse of how organ systems work together. He describes\nthe prospects of what could come from the studies of these receptors and cells\nas “exciting,” but cautions that “we’re still in the very early days” of\nfiguring it out.\n\n## Not Merely Taste and Smell Receptors\n\nOne of life’s fundamental challenges is to find food that’s good to eat and\navoid food that isn’t. Outside of our modern world of prepackaged food on\ngrocery store shelves, it’s a perilous task. Taking advantage of a new type of\nfood could mean the difference between starvation and survival, or it could\nmean an early death from accidental self-poisoning. Chemosensory receptors\nhelp us make this distinction. They’re so essential that even single-celled\nbacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ carry a type of this receptor.\n\nDespite the near universality of these receptors and their centrality to\nsurvival, scientists didn’t discover the big family of genes that encode for\nolfactory receptors until 1991, with the ones for taste receptors following in\n2000. (The olfactory receptor discovery brought the researchers Richard Axel\nand Linda Buck a Nobel Prize in 2004.) Olfactory receptors and taste receptors\nfor bitter, sweet and umami (savory) are all part of a large family of\nproteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are embedded in cell\nmembranes. Although the precise details vary from receptor to receptor, when a\nGPCR binds to the proper molecule, it sets off a signaling cascade within the\ncell. For taste and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, this cascade\ncauses neurons to fire and enables us to recognize everything from the rich\nsweetness of a chocolate chip cookie to the nose-wrinkling stench of a passing\nskunk.\n\nThe discoveries of these receptors were momentous, groundbreaking advances,\nsays Jennifer Pluznick, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But in her\nview, labeling them as olfactory and taste receptors rather than as\nchemosensory receptors entrenched the idea that they function specifically and\nexclusively in smell and taste. If scientists found signs of these receptors\nin cells outside the nose and mouth, it was easy to write them off as mistakes\nor anomalies. She herself was shocked to find an olfactory receptor called\nOlfr78 in kidney cells, a finding that she reported in 2009.\n\n### Share this article\n\n###### Copied!\n\n* * *\n\n### Newsletter\n\n _Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox_\n\nSubscribe now\n\nMost recent newsletter\n\n **Video:** In this talk presented at the 2016 TEDMED conference, Jennifer\nPluznick, an associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University,\ndiscusses the diverse function of the scent detectors found in tissues\nthroughout the body.\n\nTEDMED\n\n“I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, ‘I don’t\neven know that I can trust this data, you know?’” Pluznick recalled.\n“Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.”\n\nThis wasn’t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues.\nFor example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-\nBeechey showed in a paper published in _Biochemical Society Transactions_ that\ntaste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth.\nTheir presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine\nmight use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\n\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the\nairways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they\nshowed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the\nairways that helped to clear out obstructions.\n\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In\n2012, a research group led by Herbert’s colleague Noam Cohen at the University\nof Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen\n_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ activated those receptors and caused the cells to\nbeat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading\nbacteria and prevent infections.\n\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the\nOlfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to\nmolecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that\nresponse helped to direct the kidney’s secretion of the hormone renin, which\nregulates blood pressure. “Other labs finding similar things in other tissues\nwas both very encouraging and very exciting,” Pluznick said.\n\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove home\nthe message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve\nimportant and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those\nfunctions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting\ntissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight,\nthat application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as\nHerbert notes, being able to “taste” and “smell” minute traces of pathogens\ngives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm\nthe host’s defenses.\n\n## A Job for Tuft Cells\n\nIn researchers’ assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the\nbody, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely\nunstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since\nthe mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically\nevery organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the\npancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn’t\nled to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery\nof taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their\nlocations in the body, they certainly weren’t contributing to our sense of\ntaste.\n\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011,\nMichael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in\nthe intestines. “They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn’t\nreally have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,” said Howitt,\nwho is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the\nenigmatic cells’ function, and he eventually got his answer — through an\nunexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\n\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune\nfunction, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the\nintestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in\nthe gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard\nresearchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\n\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from\nthe mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells\npreviously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice\ncarried more protozoa in their guts than expected — specifically, a common\nsingle-celled parasite called _Tritrichomonas muris_.\n\nHowitt realized that _T. muris_ wasn’t an accidental infection but rather a\nnormal part of the microbiome in mice — something that neither he nor Garrett\nhad thought much about. “We weren’t looking for protozoa,” Howitt said. “We\nwere focused on bacteria.”\n\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the\nelevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly\npathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the\nprotozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft\ncells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\n\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with\nparasitic worms. But the increase didn’t happen in mice with defects in the\nbiochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on\nthe tuft cells.\n\nHowitt’s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for\ntuft cells in the body’s defenses — one that would fill a conspicuous hole in\nimmunologists’ understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the\nimmune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less\nabout how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and\nallergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and\nGarett’s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their\nabundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders.\nIf something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune\nsystem and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\n\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von\nMoltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing\nin on that finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical\nsignals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of\ncells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these\ncytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a\nchemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark\nintestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow\nin their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\n“Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells\ndid,” he said.\n\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in\n_Science_ and _Nature_, respectively. Together with a third paper in _Nature_\nby Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National\nCenter for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies\nprovided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize\nparasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of\nparasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the\nrelease of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of\nthe defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of\nmucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the\nparasites from the gut.\n\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what\ntuft cells do. Before this, “people just kind of ignored them or didn’t even\nrealize that they were there,” said Megan Baldridge, a molecular\nmicrobiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal\ncells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere\nthroughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to\nroll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate\nand do more than help repel the body’s invaders. In the thymus (a small\nglobular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft\ncells help teach the immune system’s maturing T cells the difference between\nself proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist\nat the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells\ncan help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And\nin Cohen’s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that\nrecognition of bacterial pathogens such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ by\nreceptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out\nmicrobe-killing chemicals.\n\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert’s at the University of\nPennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with\ninterest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with\nthe part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying\nhow tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the\nflu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to\nwonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs’ recovery from\ninfluenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched\nthe lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\n\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection,\nnewly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears\nat right). Tuft cells don’t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to\nemerge as part of the body’s response against the infection.\n\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\n“Sure enough, they were all over the place,” Vaughan said. But the tuft cells\nonly appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he\nand Herbert were “basically seeing a cell type where [it’s] not supposed to\nbe.” Although he’s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens\nafter the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body’s\nattempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune\nresponse.\n\nThe researchers don’t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or\nwhat they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually\n“taste” the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for\nthe body to respond to even minute threats.\n\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products\npresent in microenvironments within the body. “Once some of those metabolic\nproducts go out of whack … bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a\nresponse if something is wrong.”\n\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous\nsystems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose\ntools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell.\nIt isn’t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all\nevolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of\n“taste” receptors on the tongue first, “that doesn’t mean that’s the order in\nwhich it evolved.”\n\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors’ immune\nfunctions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as\nmonocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to\ndetect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed\nthat rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts\nsuggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent\nreceptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of\nother groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\n\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these\nreceptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them\nfor any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft\ncells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the\ninvaders before they’ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the\nsudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not\nalways present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\n“You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,” he\nsaid. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and\nasthma: There could be dangers “if you have too many of these cells and\nthey’re too poised to respond to the external environment.”\n\n_**Correction added Nov. 18, 2019:** The caption below the photograph of\nHerbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to\nobserve the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice._\n\n_This article was reprinted on_ _Wired.com_ _._\n\n### Carrie Arnold\n\n _Contributing Writer_\n\n* * *\n\n _November 15, 2019_\n\n* * *\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunology\n\n### Share this article\n\n###### Copied!\n\n* * *\n\n### Newsletter\n\n _Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox_\n\nSubscribe now\n\nMost recent newsletter\n\n## The Quanta Newsletter\n\n _Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox_\n\nSubscribe\n\n#### Most recent newsletter\n\n# Comment on this article\n\n _Quanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.

But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\n\nThe Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from\nSweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in\nLondon. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was\ndragged out by British police.\n\nNow Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack\ngovernment computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face\ndecades in jail.\n\nFrom behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case.\nThe decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing\nextradition request to the one from the US.\n\n## What was the Swedish investigation about?\n\nAssange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one\nfollowing a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied\nthe allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\n\nHe also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these\ncases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\n## What has the reaction been?\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish\nmove to drop the investigation.\n\nWikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the\nthreat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent\nprosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First\nAmendment.\"\n\n## What charges does Assange face in the US?\n\nAustralian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer\nintrusion in the US.\n\nHe is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government\nsecrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.\n\n  * How likely is an Assange conviction in US?\n\nIn June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an\nextradition request from the US.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Assange gestures with a thumbs up after\nhe was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London\n\nAssange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving\nthe custody period of his jail term.\n\nBut a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition\nhearing because of his \"history of absconding\".\n\nLast month, a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition\nhearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in\nLondon in February.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Sweden\n  * Wikileaks\n  * United States\n  * Julian Assange\n\n##  Share this story About sharing\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Messenger\n  * Messenger\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * WhatsApp\n  * LinkedIn\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * Video Julian Assange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy \n\n11 April 2019\n\n  * Video 'Misrule of law': Pamela Anderson's jail visit to Julian Assange \n\n7 May 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange doesn't consent to US extradition, court hears \n\n2 May 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker? \n\n19 November 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man? \n\n12 April 2019\n\n## Top Stories\n\n**Wave of Israeli strikes hit Iran's forces in Syria**\n\nIsrael's military says the strikes inside Syria were in response to rockets\nfired by Iranian troops.\n\n20 November 2019\n\n**Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him**\n\n20 November 2019\n\n**Suspect in Malta journalist murder held on yacht**\n\n20 November 2019\n\n##  Features\n\n### How a vote in Ethiopia could test Nobel prize winner\n\nVideo\n\n### Meet the women on a mission to clear landmines\n\nVideo\n\n### Three tips to win an election debate\n\n### Why do billions of people still not have glasses?\n\n### How to buy an Instagram following\n\n### Amazon gets closer to getting Alexa everywhere\n\n### Zimbabwe - the land where cash barons thrive\n\nVideo\n\n### Sucking up CO2 from one of the world's worst emitters\n\n### BBC Future: The race to escape Arctic sea ice\n\n##  Elsewhere on the BBC\n\n###  Lyrics quiz\n\nHave you been getting these songs wrong?\n\nFull article Lyrics quiz\n\n###  Feeling hot\n\nWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?\n\nFull article Feeling hot\n\nWhy you can trust BBC News\n\n## BBC News Navigation\n\nWorld Sections\n\n  * Africa\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Europe selected\n  * Latin America\n  * Middle East\n  * US & Canada\n\n  * Home\n  * Video\n  * World selected\n\n    * World Home\n    * Africa\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * Europe selected\n    * Latin America\n    * Middle East\n    * US & Canada\n\n  * UK\n\n    * UK Home\n    * England\n    * N.

We’re on it.’: Spokane ad agencies divided on South Dakota’s viral\ncampaign\n\nUPDATED: Tue., Nov. 19, 2019\n\nMaterials from South Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign.\n(onmeth.com)\n\n__Twitter\n\n__Facebook\n\n__Email\n\n__Reddit\n\n__SMS\n\nBy Megan Rowe __meganr@spokesman.com(509) 459-5382\n\nSouth Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing\nbacklash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response\nwas concern.\n\nHege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding\nfirm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign\n“Starts with one.”\n\n“I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of\nattention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the\nend of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good\nevaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel\nconcerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the\nbehaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\n\nWhen developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third\nyear in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences,\nworking with them directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values\nregarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior\nis much more difficult, Hege said.\n\n“It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the\nmost important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege\nsaid. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a\npositive impact in the world.”\n\nWhile the “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham,\nWashington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she\ndid not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful\nfor its audience.\n\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can\neither be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not\nintended to see it,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that\nencouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive\nscreenings.\n\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that\nmight be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt\nlike it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might\nhave a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general\npublic saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they\nmight think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a\nspecific population.”\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering\nthe example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on\ngaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot\nof young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s\na thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might\nbe looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very\naudience-centric.”\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising\nand design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a\nMinneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise\neyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the\ndining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings\nand other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about\nit, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want\nthem talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about?\nSouth Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South\nDakota brand.”\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That\nmessage is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to\ntry to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their\nmessage somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the\ncore and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that\neverybody in America reads.”\n\n**Wordcount:** 717\n\n**Published:** Nov. 19, 2019, 6:18 p.m. **Updated:** Nov. 19, 2019, 7:10 p.m.\n\n**Tags:** ads, advertisement, awareness, meth, methamphetamine, nation, news,\nsouth dakota\n\n__\n\n## Subscribe to the Morning Review newsletter\n\nGet the day’s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by\nsubscribing to our newsletter.\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed!\n\nThere was a problem subscribing you to the newsletter.

A review of surveillance video allegedly\nshowed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night,\naccording to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of\nfederal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,”\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said\nin a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks\non inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records.\nNoel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is\ncharged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the\ncharges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday\nafternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond\nwithin a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many\nvictims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nAttorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered\nmultiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations\nat the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\n## Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage\nover the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the\nprison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer,\nrepeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track\nof such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify\nagainst his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of\nminor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other\nlocations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of\nPrisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some\nanswers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of\nJeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives\nbehind bars,” Sasse said.\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation\nand a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she\nacknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other\ninstances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and\nfalsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This\nincident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad\nstaff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when\nsomething bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems\nwithin the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of\nthe system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier\nmay have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports\nanything other than suicide.\n\n**Internal memo:** Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks,\ninmate counts\n\n## Investigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself\nwith a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he\nhad been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned\nto Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers\nassigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at\nleast eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10,\nprosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that\nthey had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do\nany rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court\nhearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos.\nThey and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our\nhope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said\nJason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a\nplea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of\nthree children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to\naddress the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,”\nFiggins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that\nthey’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re\ngoing to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night\nEpstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran\nand how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll\nhave a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\n## Prisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and\nfrequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised\nsecurity at the Manhattan facility.\n\n**Staffers 'don't care':** Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before\nJeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at\nthe facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union.\nPrison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to\nplug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift,\nthe one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to\nfederal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the\n20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention\ncenter, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave.\nOne of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime\nshifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling\nlawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the\nsystem.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure\nof old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the\ncountry, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying,\n\"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s\ntrust in us.”\n\n**Epstein's inner circle eyed:** Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could\nstill go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nThis March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender\nRegistry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nNew York State Sex Offender Registry via AP\n\n## Epstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell,\nsemiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him\non suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has\ndrawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from\nsuicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the\ninmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be\ncritical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra\nmonitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert\nfrom San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature\nof his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior\nsuicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to\nsee authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there\nare no coincidences.”\n\n_Contributing: Kristine Phillips_\n\nPublished 7:07 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© Copyright Gannett 2018\n\n"

(credit: NASA/Jude\nGuidry)  \n  \n---  \n  \n# Seeking a bigger role for a big rocket\n\n### by Jeff Foust  \nMonday, November 18, 2019\n\n  \n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of\nits long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud\nAssembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four\nRS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the\ncore stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center\nfor testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where\nthose four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS\nlaunch.\n\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and\nground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier\ndate,” Cooke said.  \n---  \n  \nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in\nthe 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While\nthe plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will\nnonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite\ncost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least\nlate 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it\nwould be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly\nnot limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some\nmembers of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is,\nNASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current\nexploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with\nthe more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer\nlaunches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s\nown party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last\n40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon\nand Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian\nBabin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space\nsubcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS)\nprocurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers\nthat NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be\nlaunched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final\nversion did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided\nthey worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo\nversion of the SLS.)\n\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses\nmidstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view,\nminimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s\ncurrent architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched\ncommercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The\nlunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did\npropose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the\nascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander\nfrom the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical\noperations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said\nDoug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an\nindustry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House\nsubcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS\ncore stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views\nlong before working with Boeing.)\n\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said\nof returning to the Moon.  \n---  \n  \n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry\nOrion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS\nwith the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance\nof making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two\nSLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the\ntwo rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom\nStafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment.\nRep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them\nabout the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission\nsafety.\n\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a\nmember of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier\ntestimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success\nwith the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of\nsuccess goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-\nlift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to\nmake it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big,\nwide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus\ncommercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in\nprocurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the\nMars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment,\nhe brought up the HLS program.\n\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to\nthe surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be\ngovernment-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human\nspaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think\nthat the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number\ntwo is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done\nthat will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really\nsee a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although\nit could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a\ncompelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an\nadditional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”  \n---  \n  \nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of\nCongress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing\nlast month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep.\nRobert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater\nuse of SLS.\n\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for\nSLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said,\nincluding the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to\nsupport that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed\nthe second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the\nacting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA\nand the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced\nby 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first\ncrewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024\nthat would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface\nof the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident\nthat could happen.”\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch\nvehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to\nlaunch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the\nMoon by 2024?”\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But\nfor the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy\nand Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from\nBlue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re\nnot shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some\ninvestment from Boeing to achieve.”\n\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not\navailable by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy\nis, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt\nasked again.\n\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing\nin 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the\nadditional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu\nwe’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of\npotential spending shortfalls for Artemis.  \n---  \n  \nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets,\nciting Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged\nthat more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall\narchitecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more\nlaunches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing\nSystem how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re\nwaiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess\ntheir approaches.”\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that\nits approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day\nthe proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would\ninvolve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have\ndeveloped a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission\ncomplexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar\nsurface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing\nDefense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led\nby Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.\nThe companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles\nwould be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely\nbelieved to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the\ncompany has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House\nnor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion\nbudget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis\non track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY),\nchairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without\nmore information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has\nyet to disclose.\n\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal\nyear when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested\npushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to\nthis March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission\nfor the benefit of the American people and the world.”\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the\nodds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said.\n“This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments\nalready made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for\nreturning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also\ninclude revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\n* * *\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space\nReview, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

The five companies can\nnow vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to\npave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\"\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group\nof companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface\ndrives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We\nanticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology\npayloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance\nour goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\n **Related:** **SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures**\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018,\nbringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nNASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help\nreturn astronauts to the moon in 2024.\n\n(Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.\n\n(Image credit: Blue Origin)\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nThis Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's\ncommercial lunar lander for NASA.\n\n(Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the\nmoon's surface.\n\n(Image credit: Ceres Robotics)\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nThis illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems,\nInc.\n\n(Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)\n\n  * Blue Origin, Kent, Washington\n  * Ceres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\n  * Sierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\n  * SpaceX, Hawthorne, California\n  * Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly\nmassive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the\nmoon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak\nNano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of\nprivate industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's\nassociate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the\nstatement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our\nability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and\nsupport human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which\nthe company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that\ncould potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to\ndeliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration\nRover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power\nstations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through\nNovember 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the\nprogram can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\"\nClarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to\nreally broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new,\ninnovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding\nlander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond.\nOrbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on\nfuture opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new\ntechnology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do\nmuch more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our\ncommercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate\nadministrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the\nstatement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by\n2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around\nthe moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on\nMars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have\nstressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers.\nThis past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build\nprototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the\nArtemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early\nnext year.\n\n  * Moon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\n  * Here's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\n  * NASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\n _Editor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details\nfrom the NASA telecon._\n\n _Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _._\n_Follow us on Twitter_ _ _@Spacedotcom__ _and on_ _ _Facebook__ _._\n\n _Need more space?_ _Subscribe to our sister title \"All About Space\" Magazine_\n_for the latest amazing news from the final frontier!_\n\n(Image credit: All About Space)\n\n_Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

In the end, we will\nwin and save our Country from certain destruction,” Trump tweeted soon after\nthe House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public\nimpeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a\nUkraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer\nWilliams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July\n25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison,\nanother top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats’ central allegation in this\nimpeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n“Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no\nindication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating\nhis previous deposition testimony that ‘there was no linkage like that,\" she\nsaid.\n\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the\nDemocrats.\n\n“With the Democrats’ poll-tested ‘quid-pro-quo’ and ‘bribery’ narratives in\nshambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for\none more second,” Grisham said.\n\n“We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate ‘impeachment’\nproceedings. However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and\nconjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both\nwitnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing\nPresident Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime,” she\nadded.\n\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for\nPresident Trump.\n\n“Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats\nare simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to\noverturn the outcome of a free and fair election,” Grisham said.\n\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump’s request to\nUkrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with\nAmerican national security goals.\n\n“Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of\nshock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy\ncould play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant\nimplications for US national security,” Vindman said.\n\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n“I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the\npresident's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different\nthan other calls I had listened to,” she said.\n\n“I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such\nas former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature\ngiven that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,”\nWilliams said.\n\n“I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I\njust noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,” she said in\nresponse to a question.\n\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016\nelections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be\nconspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly\nthe former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be\npursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n“We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight\nagainst corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense\ncapabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't\nthink pursuing these things serves a national interest,” Volker said.\n\nDH Newsletter  Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n\nGET IT\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWhite House\n\nUkraine\n\nUSA\n\n0 Comments (+)\n\n###  Related stories\n\n####  Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n####  150 Indians deported from US land at Delhi airport...\n\n####  Diehards remain at HK campus as foreign pressure grows...\n\n####  US, China fossil fuel polluters far off climate targets...\n\n####  'Climate impacts to cost world $7.9 trillion by 2050'...\n\n####  Oil prices steady after 2-day drop amid growth concerns...\n\n### DH Picks\n\n  * ####  PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr... \n\n  * ####  Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year \n\n  * ####  KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams... \n\n  * ####  Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill \n\n  * ####  Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes... \n\n##  social feed\n\n#### What does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n  * Politics\n  * North and Central\n  * South\n  * East and Northeast\n  * West\n\nKarnataka\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Politics\n  * Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Bengaluru Crime\n  * Politics\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n  * Cricket\n  * ICC World Cup 2019\n  * Formula 1 with DH\n  * Football\n  * Tennis\n  * Sportscene\n  * Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n  * Business News\n  * Budget 2019\n  * Economy & Business\n  * Family Finance\n  * Technology\n  * DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n  * Videos\n  * Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n  * DH Views\n  * Editorials\n  * Panorama\n  * Comment\n  * In Perspective\n  * Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n  * Entertainment News\n  * DH Talkies\n  * Arts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\n  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep \n  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\n  * Pawar meets Modi, briefs on farm crisis in Maharashtra\n  * A Dhankhar-shaped question around the role of governors\n  * Don't mix politics and security to leaders: Cong in RS\n  * Vodafone Idea, Airtel rally for 4th consecutive season\n  * RIL market cap inches closer to Rs 10 lakh crore\n\nTrending news\n\n  * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n  * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n  * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n  * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n  * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\n  * About\n  * Epaper\n  * Newsletter\n  * Archives\n  * Sitemap\n  * Classifieds\n  * Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n  * Printers Mysore\n  * Prajavani\n  * Sudha\n  * Mayura\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms\n  * Disclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  *   *   *   *   * X Share via\n    *     *     *     * Share permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user\nexperience.

I am totally that person for my family when it\ncomes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store\ngift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart\nspeakers aren’t always the right gift.\n\nThat’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different.\nLast year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home\nproducts, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\nBut there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve\nreceived for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read\non to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\n### Satechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C\non MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple\nlaptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook\nwould struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs.\nA better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage,\nand now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit _while\ncharging in the car_.\n\nSatechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve\ntested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It\nfeatures two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you\ncharge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even\nduring use.\n\nIt’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m\nstill amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro\nwhen just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery\npercentage while charging.\n\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and\nanother with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from\nSatechi.\n\n### RAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\nIt’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air\nand MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of\npower delivery but in miniaturization.\n\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and\nreliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than\nwhat Apple includes in the box.\n\nRAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for\niPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away\nfrom owning a third.\n\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact\nthat it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers\npleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials\nUSB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my\ntop tech discoveries this year.\n\n### Mophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat\nproject first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to\nfill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone,\nApple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nWhile no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless\ncharging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that\nstands out.\n\nMophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot\nfor charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging\nCase, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own\nand makes for a great gift.\n\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a\ncouple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my\nnightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\nPrior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version\n(pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience,\nbut I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the\nApple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless\ncharging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for\n$60 less.\n\nEven with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward\nthis year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods,\nApple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless\ncharger on my nightstand.\n\n### Samsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung\nTV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple\nintroduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending\naudio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV\nshows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and\neven watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple\nTV Channels.\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed\nover to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try.\nThat turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for\n$278.\n\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 _before_ you\nfactor the cost of a new TV.\n\nI’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since\nAirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly\nrecommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room\nwithout spending a fortune.\n\n### Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next\ngeneration of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this\nyear. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than\n802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take\nadvantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery\nbetween multiple mesh routers).\n\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included.\niPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices\nwith Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join\nnext year.\n\nIf you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to\ntreat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a\nfuture pick this year that you can buy now.\n\nI’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400,\ncurrently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and\nearly results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as\nyour tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh\nbang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-\npack.\n\n### Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse\nthat came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek\npart.\n\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again\nonly to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master\n2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much\nthat I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was\nsomehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed\n$99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside\nthe $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great\npair.\n\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and\ncharge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same\ncharger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX\nMaster 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys\nwireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\nThen there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse\nand keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro _and_ my iPad Pro, and\nswitching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly\nrecommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro\neven further.\n\n### Brydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before\nthe end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing\nboard with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned\nkeyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s\nnot the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or\nSmart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in\nmy house.\n\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her\n12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even\nafter a keyboard repair.\n\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for\nmyself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio.\niPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible\nfor her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt\nto her.\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth,\nbacklit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard\ncase. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129,\nregular $149) since the day she got it.\n\nIt may not be _for me_ , but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case\namong former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\n_Looking for more gift recommendations?

Credit: SpaceX\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a\ncontract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the\nmoon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nNASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada\nCorporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected\nto join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)\ncontracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for\nthe delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\nThis “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the\ncapability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes\nNASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a\nrover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south\npole of the moon.\n\n“We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need\nto accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for\nexploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a\nteleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver\ntools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to\ndelivering science payloads.\n\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its\nStarship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief\noperating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to\n100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified\namount back to Earth.\n\n“We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS\nprogram,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation\nServices effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo\ncapability.\n\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such\nmissions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping\nstone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions,\nbut said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with\npeople on board.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for\nits small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\n\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in\nMay, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a\nlot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large,\nopen payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced\ndevelopment programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the\nlander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the\nspecifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a\ngreat position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because\nwe build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of\nbusiness development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads\nleveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not\ndisclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to\nstart lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award\nwas a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space\nexploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire\necosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a\ncreativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be\navailable for missions starting in 2023.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer.\nMarco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage\nthat experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something\nsmaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead\nus to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined\nto say when his company’s lander would be ready.\n\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-\nramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year\nago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive\nMachines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond.\nIn May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and\nOrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order\ntwo months later, citing internal business issues.\n\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be\nreleased “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for\nthe VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for\nscience instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two\n“deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\n__________\n\nCommercial  Blue OriginCeres RoboticsCLPSlunar landerSierra Nevada\nCorp.SpaceXTyvak\n\n  \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nsearch Search\n\n* * * ## Most Read\n\n* ## Upcoming Events\n\n#### Upcoming Events\n\nSee Allarrow\n\nNov 20\n\n####  APSCC Satellite Conference & Exhibition\n\nNov 20\n\n####  Space Tech Expo Europe\n\nNov 20\n\n####  SpaceCom 2019\n\nSpaceNews\n\n2019 Spacenews, Inc.

The news organization,\nciting an anonymous government source, reported that President Donald Trump's\nreluctance to roll back tariffs was dampening China's outlook on trade talks.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 (N225) declined 0.3%, while South Korea's Kospi Index\n(KOSPI) fell 0.5%. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) slumped 0.2%, but\nrecovered those losses and was last trading up 0.4%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) started in the red, but was last trading up\nabout 1%. Hong Kong stocks have been trying to claw back some losses after\nlast week, when the index recorded its worst stretch since early August amid\nworsening protests in the city.\n\nThe United States once again kicks the Huawei can down the road\n\n\"With no significant data releases in Asia today, attention in the region will\nremain focused on trade concerns and Hong Kong,\" said Jeffrey Halley, a market\nanalyst with the research firm Oanda, in a note. \"Neither is likely to inspire\nthe confidence of market participants.\"\n\nRead More\n\nUS stock futures were last trading slightly positive during Asian trading\nhours after recording small losses earlier.\n\nA breakthrough in the US-China trade deal has remained just out of reach for\nquite some time. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been expected to\nsign a partial trade deal for about a month, but those negotiations hit\nanother snag last week.\n\nThe US government on Monday did extend a temporary general license allowing\nAmerican companies to sell to Huawei, the embattled Chinese tech company that\nhas become a symbol of tensions between the two countries. It's the third\n90-day extension of the license, which is now set to expire in February.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * World\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * China\n    * Europe\n    * India\n    * Middle East\n    * United Kingdom\n  * US Politics\n    * 45\n    * Congress\n    * SCOTUS\n    * Facts First\n    * 2020\n    * 2019 Elections\n  * Business\n    * Markets\n    * Tech\n    * Media\n    * Success\n    * Perspectives\n    * Videos\n  * Health\n    * Food\n    * Fitness\n    * Wellness\n    * Parenting\n    * Vital Signs\n  * Entertainment\n    * Stars\n    * Screen\n    * Binge\n    * Culture\n    * Media\n  * Tech\n    * Innovate\n    * Gadget\n    * Mission: Ahead\n    * Upstarts\n    * Work Transformed\n    * Innovative Cities\n  * Style\n    * Arts\n    * Design\n    * Fashion\n    * Architecture\n    * Luxury\n    * Autos\n    * Video\n  * Travel\n    * Destinations\n    * Food & Drink\n    * Play\n    * Stay\n    * Videos\n  * Sports\n    * Football\n    * Tennis\n    * Equestrian\n    * Golf\n    * Skiing\n    * Horse Racing\n    * Motorsport\n    * Sailing\n    * Rugby\n    * Formula E\n    * Esports\n  * Videos\n    * Live TV \n    * Digital Studios\n    * CNN Films\n    * HLN\n    * TV Schedule\n    * TV Shows A-Z\n    * CNNVR\n  * Features\n    * Freedom Project\n    * Impact Your World\n    * Inside Africa\n    * 2 Degrees\n    * CNN Heroes\n    * All Features\n  * More\n    * Photos\n    * Longform\n    * Investigations\n    * CNN Profiles\n    * CNN Leadership\n    * CNN Newsletters\n    * Work for CNN\n\n* * *\n\nFollow CNN Business\n\n  *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange \n\n# Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\n\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:50 GMT\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (AFP)\n\nHighlights\n\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of\nSweden’s attorney general.\n\n**Sweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.**\n\n“After conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the\ncourse of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the\nevidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,”\nSweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on\nTuesday.\n\nPersson explained that the complainant’s evidence had initially been deemed\ncredible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made\nclear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened,\nprimarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses’ memories had faded\nfor natural reasons.\n\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of\nSweden’s attorney general.\n\nAssange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of\npublishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing\nthe rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange\nbecause the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the\nAustralian national remained in London.\n\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after\nhe was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and\npromptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status.\nThat came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid\nextradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\nFollowing Assange’s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the\ncase asked for the investigation to be resumed.  \nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related\nallegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in\nBritain for skipping bail.\n\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the\nrelease of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing\nhundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars\nin Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted\nof all the charges against him there.\n\n_This article has been adapted from its original source._\n\nVia SyndiGate.info  \n\n  \n\nCopyright © 2019 Press TV.

And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\nXi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass\ndisorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security\nimpotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's\nregime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine\nright of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to\nlead.\n\nTo be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want\nto send the army into Hong Kong.\n\nThey know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure\notherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel\nMacron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither\ncan Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party\nappears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears:\nresistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its\nglobal agenda.\n\nAnd Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and\nmanifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to\nBeijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of\ncommunications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence.\nBut Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the\nprotesters into new resistance.\n\nNor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the\nprotests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to\nfall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A\nrecent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal\nby the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively\nindependent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between\nauthoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\nAt the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are\ndeluding themselves.\n\nUnlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the\nAmerican-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not\nyears. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of\nindividual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his\nChinese dream. Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a\nyear or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi\nwill choose the former.\n\nIn short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nChina\n\nXi Jinping\n\nHong Kong\n\nProtests\n\nBeijing\n\n  * __\n  * __\n\n__ Share your thoughts with friends.\n\n  * \n\n  * #####  More Washington Examiner \n\n    * #####  Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago\nTuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed\nand arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are\nhighly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his\nnightmare will finally end.\n\n    * #####  What made _Joker_ so popular?\n\nMadeline Fry\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nJoker killed at the box office.\n\n    * #####  Sen. David Perdue: Democrats’ socialist agenda would kill the American dream\n\nSen. David Perdue\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nWednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home\nstate of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.\n\n    * #####  Surprise! Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press,\nNational Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study\nshowed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S.\ndetention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest\nrate of children in detention.”\n\n    * #####  Marie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so\nfar with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of\nthe impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\n    * #####  Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and\npersonal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including\nAmbassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie\nYovanovitch.\n\n    * #####  Kurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting\nAmbassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine\npolicy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker\nsought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday,\nmaking himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n    * #####  Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nPeople are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment\n“scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly\nclosed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his\njob. Here is what we learned:\n\n    * #####  Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-\nUkraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to\nUkraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr\nZelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n    * #####  First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be\nheld on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n    * #####  Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\nTiana Lowe\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did\nPresident Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign\ngovernment to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats\nattempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the\npivot bombed fantastically.\n\n    * #####  It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on\nTuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with\nUkraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not\nleak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n    * #####  'Dictators': Europe is waking up to threats from China, defense experts say\n\nJoel Gehrke\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nChina’s attempt to gain economic influence in Europe poses major strategic\nthreats to American allies, according to defense officials, including one on\nthe front lines of NATO.\n\n    * #####  Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nMonday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no\nlonger donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community\nleft some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the\nmilitant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\ncontinue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the\nannouncement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold\nChristian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\"\nwill not be satisfied.\n\n    * #####  Kemp Foundation embraces free enterprise's creative disruption\n\nQuin Hillyer\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nJimmy Kemp sounds a whole lot like his eloquent father, the late Republican\nofficial and idea man Jack Kemp, and this is a very good thing. The U.S.\npolitical world needs to start rehearing the Kempian message.\n\n    * #####  The kind of gay rights legislation conservatives should support\n\nBrad Polumbo\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nReligious liberty and conscience rights are certainly worth defending against\nan increasing liberal onslaught. A female wax technician should never be\nforced by the state to wax a transgender woman’s testicles. Nor should a\nChristian baker be forced to endorse messages he doesn’t believe in. All have\nthe First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech, and that right\ndoesn't disappear when we begin to engage in business.\n\n  * About Examiner\n\n  * Magazine Archive\n\n  * Staff\n\n  * Advertise\n\n  * Contact\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n###### Copyright 2019.

Prior to\nlaunch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7\nteraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high\nsettings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\n\nAccording to The Verge’s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run\nits showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a\nstatement…\n\nGoogle Stadia Pricing for Games Available Now – Pro Subscribers Get Discounts\n\n> When streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and\n> apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\n\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So,\nin other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X\nversion, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny\n2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's\nrevealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders\nat 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the\nXbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line\nexperience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-\nthan-ideal visual performance.\n\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t\n_terrible_. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at\nStadia as a replacement for consoles, it’s not a bad alternative. That said,\nGoogle promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet.\nHopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience\nsoon.\n\nThe Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a\nChromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including\nUnited States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

That\nmeans people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a\nmedical professional to overcome it.\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually\nlarge amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a\nstrong sense of guilt or shame.\n\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health\nconditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and\nwith the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\n## 1\\. Ditch the diet\n\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly\nrestrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was\nassociated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain\nfoods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or\nsignificantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making\nhealthy changes.\n\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole\ngrains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from\nyour diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better\nhealth.\n\n>  **Summary** Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from\n> your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on\n> eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods\n> completely.\n\n## 2\\. Avoid skipping meals\n\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most\neffective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased\nlevels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater\nextent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was\nassociated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\n>  **Summary** Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of\n> overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting\n> blood sugar.\n\n## 3\\. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying\nattention to how you feel at the moment.\n\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize\nwhen they no longer feel hungry.\n\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation\ndecreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive\nbehavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally,\ntry to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\n>  **Summary** Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you’re no\n> longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the\n> incidence of binge eating.\n\n## 4\\. Stay hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to\ncurb cravings and stop overeating.\n\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to\ndecreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500\nml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by\n13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces\n(375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger\nand calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\nOther studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and\nweight loss (10, 11).\n\nThe amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors.\nThus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to\nensure you’re staying well hydrated.\n\n>  **Summary** Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease\n> calorie intake and prevent binge eating.\n\n## 5\\. Try yoga\n\nYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific\nbreathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance\nrelaxation.\n\nStudies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce\nthe risk of emotional eating.\n\nOne small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks\nled to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\nAnother study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating\ndisorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances\n— all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\nResearch also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like\ncortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\nTry joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your\nroutine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\n>  **Summary** Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common\n> triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.\n\n## 6\\. Eat more fiber\n\nFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full\nlonger (16).\n\nSome research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce\nappetite, and food intake.\n\nOne small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of\nfiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing\nfullness (17).\n\nAnother study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber\ndaily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and\nsignificantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\nFruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods\nthat can keep you feeling full.\n\n>  **Summary** Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake\n> and feelings of hunger.\n\n## 7\\. Clean out the kitchen\n\nHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much\neasier to binge eat.\n\nConversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional\neating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\nStart by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-\npackaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\nStocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole\ngrains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge\neating unhealthy foods.\n\n>  **Summary** Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on\n> healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge\n> eat.\n\n## 8\\. Start hitting the gym\n\nStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge\neating.\n\nFor instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly\nexercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\nAnother study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with\nregular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of\nbinge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\nPlus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and\nenhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\nWalking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few\ndifferent forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce\nbinge eating.\n\n>  **Summary** Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge\n> eating and decrease stress levels.\n\n## 9\\. Eat breakfast every day\n\nStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge\neating later in the day.\n\nSeveral studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is\nassociated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone\nthat stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\nPlus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings\nand reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\nFor example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast\nreduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb\nbreakfast (22).\n\nMeanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve\nappetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\nTry combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole\ngrains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\n>  **Summary** Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings\n> and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.\n\n## 10\\. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be\nlinked to binge eating.\n\nIn fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported\nsignificantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this\ncondition (24).\n\nAnother large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with\nhigher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the\nhormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body\nweight (25).\n\nAim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check\nand reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\n>  **Summary** BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep\n> deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect\n> hunger and appetite.\n\n## 11\\. Keep a food and mood journal\n\nKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can\nbe an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food\ntriggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\nOne study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that\ninvolved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes\nof binge eating (26).\n\nSeveral other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to\nincreased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\nTo get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day\nusing either a journal or app.\n\n>  **Summary** Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address\n> potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with\n> fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.\n\n## 12\\. Find someone to talk to\n\nTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your\nlikelihood of overeating.\n\nOne study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that\nreliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\nAnother study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was\nlinked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\nA good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which\nmay help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32,\n33).\n\nNext time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted\nfriend or family member. If you don’t have someone to talk to, eating disorder\nhelplines are available free of charge.\n\n>  **Summary** A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge\n> eating and stress.\n\n## 13\\. Increase your protein intake\n\nUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help\ncontrol your appetite.\n\nOne study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30%\nled to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as\ndecreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\nSimilarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced\nmetabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite\n(35).\n\nTry including at least one good source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts,\nseeds, or legumes — in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel\nhungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\n>  **Summary** Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease\n> calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1,\n> a hormone that can help suppress appetite.\n\n## 14\\. Plan meals\n\nPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to\nprepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the\nremainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\nIn fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was\nassociated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower\nrisk of obesity (36).\n\nMeal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which\nhas been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nSet aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your\nmeals.\n\n>  **Summary** Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet\n> quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern\n> easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.\n\n## 15\\. Seek help\n\nWhile the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan\ndesigned by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\nTreatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to\nhelp get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the\nconnection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then\ndevelops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\nOther types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical\nbehavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss\ntherapy (37).\n\nAntidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also\nsometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the\nlong-term effects of these medications (38, 39).\n\n>  **Summary** Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective\n> treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain\n> medications can also be used.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people\naround the world.\n\nHowever, it’s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and\nhealthy lifestyle modifications.\n\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD on November 14, 2019\n\n## related stories\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder History: A Timeline\n\n  * What’s the Difference Between Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder?\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Understanding Your Triggers\n\n  * Can Antidepressants Treat Binge Eating Disorder?\n\n### Read this next\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n\nWritten by Elise Mandl, BSc, APD\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is the most common type of eating disorder.

News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an\ninsider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have\noperational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these\nnegotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record\nlabel, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber,\nDemi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29,\nhowever the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s\ncalls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\n **TAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN,\nBIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT**\n\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on\nJune 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for\nIthaca Holdings)\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider\nadded of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it\npossible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards\nafter Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned\ncompany of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own\nthe master recordings, at the AMAs\n\n **A LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT'S FEUDS**\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and\nDick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that\napproves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast\non mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not\nonly cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\nVideo\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live\nperformances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is\nonly needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in\ndetermining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to\nan agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that\nit had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\nBraun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s\nfirst six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s\n“Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von\nHolden/Invision/AP)\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or\ndistribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding\nTaylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production\ncompany said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on\nthis matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We\nhave no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big\nMachine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has\nbeen working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its\nwebsite.\n\nVideo\n\n **TAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING'\nCLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE**\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her\ntumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read.\n\"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her\nNetflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing\nlive anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have\ncontinued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties\nas she promotes her current record in which we do not financially\nparticipate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars\nand multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking\nemployees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have\nworked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and\nher team to productively move forward.\n\nVideo\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as\nrecently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our\npersistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution,\nTaylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a\ncalculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their\nfamilies,\" the statement concluded.\n\n **CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP**\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big\nMachine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them\nbut, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes\nTaylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\n\n _Fox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report._\n\nJulius is an LA Entertainment Reporter for Fox News.\n\n### On Our Radar\n\n#### Gronk's SI girlfriend tells all\n\n#### 'Bach' SHOCKING sex confession\n\n#### Arnold's love child recreates iconic pic\n\n#### Elizabeth Hurley doesn't age\n\n#### Serious allegation against Markle\n\n#### 'Dukes' star: I 'didn't see it coming'\n\n#### How Elvis bombed at Opry\n\nTaste of Country\n\n#### Trending in Entertainment\n\n  * ##### 'Bachelor' alum Amanda Stanton says parenting makes self-care hard\n\n  * ##### Hollywood exec suggested Julia Roberts should play Harriet Tubman\n\n  * ##### Kelly Clarkson laughs off 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' backlash: 'We didn't kill Christmas'\n\n  * ##### Tom Hanks discovers he's related to Fred Rogers: report\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n###### U.S.\n\n  * Crime\n  * Military\n  * Education\n  * Terror\n  * Immigration\n  * Economy\n  * Personal Freedoms\n  * Fox News Investigates\n\n###### World\n\n  * U.N.\n  * Conflicts\n  * Terrorism\n  * Disasters\n  * Global Economy\n  * Environment\n  * Religion\n  * Scandals\n\n###### Opinion\n\n###### Politics\n\n  * Executive\n  * Senate\n  * House\n  * Judiciary\n  * Foreign policy\n  * Polls\n  * Elections\n\n###### Entertainment\n\n  * Celebrity News\n  * Movies\n  * TV News\n  * Music News\n  * Style News\n  * Entertainment Video\n\n###### Business\n\n  * Markets\n  * Politics\n  * Technology\n  * Features\n  * Business Leaders\n\n###### Lifestyle\n\n  * Food + Drink\n  * Cars + Trucks\n  * Travel + Outdoors\n  * House + Home\n  * Fitness + Well-being\n  * Style + Beauty\n  * Family\n\n###### Science\n\n  * Archaeology\n  * Air & Space\n  * Planet Earth\n  * Wild Nature\n  * Natural Science\n  * Dinosaurs\n\n###### Tech\n\n  * Security\n  * Innovation\n  * Drones\n  * Computers\n  * Video Games\n  * Military Tech\n\n###### Health\n\n  * Healthy Living\n  * Medical Research\n  * Mental Health\n  * Cancer\n  * Heart Health\n  * Children's Health\n\n###### TV\n\n  * Shows\n  * Personalities\n  * Watch Live\n  * Full Episodes\n  * Show Clips\n  * News Clips\n\n######  About\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Careers\n  * Fox Around the World\n  * Advertise With Us\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Media Relations\n  * Compliance\n  * Supplier Diversity\n\n######  Other\n\n  * Fox Nation\n  * Fox News Shop\n  * Fox News Go\n  * Fox News Radio\n  * Newsletters\n  * Alerts\n  * Podcasts\n  * Apps & Products\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * Google+\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS\n  * Email\n\nFox News\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Updated Privacy Policy(What's Changed)\n  * Closed Captioning Policy\n  * Help\n  * Contact Us\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize**\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set\npriorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable based, low in\nfat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full,\nso you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just\nchoose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at\nthat.\n\n### **2\\. Don’t forget to drink water**\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even\nhelp prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else\nalcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer\nwith a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy\ninstead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just\nbecause they’re there.\n\n### **3\\. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate**\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re\nfeeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and\nguacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, we’ve\nconsumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone\nfeeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate,\nand eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating,\nand to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n### **4\\. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip**\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy\ndip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie\ninstead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the\nfact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up\nyour favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and\ncrunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has\naround four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or\nmayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\n### **Healthy Game Day Dip:**\n\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa.\nA quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and\nyou’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n### **5\\. Go topless (with your sub)**\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both\nsides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories —\nabout the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be\nsmart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.”\nThat’s why I always tell my clients: “an open face is a happy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out\nat a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the\ngreat company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\n**Get started with2B Mindset here.**\n\n###  Related Articles\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  Why Am I Not Losing Weight?\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  You CAN Lose Weight Without “Starving”\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  Smart Food Swaps to Outsmart Diet Deprivation\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Instagram\n\n  * Join our newsletter\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Instagram\n\n  * Join our newsletter\n\nThe information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community\npages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a\nUS audience.

Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe\neven routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House\nwho have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including\nthe President's health -- that should force any rational person to question\nthe explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years\nold and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his\nmost recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243\npounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a\ncommon form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical\ncorrespondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant\nthat the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5\nyears, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n\nRead More\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as\nthe President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and\nget on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is\nvery little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources\ntold CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food\nintake and exercise habits.\n\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual\nphysical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said\nHogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It\nwas unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule\nand was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up\nthat a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House\npress secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a\njump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or\nover multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider\nthat Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the\npast.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential\nprimary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold\nBornstein.\n\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of\nTrump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the\nhealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had!\nBornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't\nwrite that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions\nabout whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president\nwas made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump\ndoing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's\nhealth an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen\nfeeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false\nor misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's\nFact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White\nHouse is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n  * \n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to\nthe President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a\nroutine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given\nplenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively\ntrying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given\n\"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which,\nof course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the\ntruth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take\nthe White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been\nfalse. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should\nyou.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * World\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * China\n    * Europe\n    * India\n    * Middle East\n    * United Kingdom\n  * US Politics\n    * 45\n    * Congress\n    * SCOTUS\n    * Facts First\n    * 2020\n    * 2019 Elections\n  * Business\n    * Markets\n    * Tech\n    * Media\n    * Success\n    * Perspectives\n    * Videos\n  * Health\n    * Food\n    * Fitness\n    * Wellness\n    * Parenting\n    * Vital Signs\n  * Entertainment\n    * Stars\n    * Screen\n    * Binge\n    * Culture\n    * Media\n  * Tech\n    * Innovate\n    * Gadget\n    * Mission: Ahead\n    * Upstarts\n    * Work Transformed\n    * Innovative Cities\n  * Style\n    * Arts\n    * Design\n    * Fashion\n    * Architecture\n    * Luxury\n    * Autos\n    * Video\n  * Travel\n    * Destinations\n    * Food & Drink\n    * Play\n    * Stay\n    * Videos\n  * Sports\n    * Football\n    * Tennis\n    * Equestrian\n    * Golf\n    * Skiing\n    * Horse Racing\n    * Motorsport\n    * Sailing\n    * Rugby\n    * Formula E\n    * Esports\n  * Videos\n    * Live TV \n    * Digital Studios\n    * CNN Films\n    * HLN\n    * TV Schedule\n    * TV Shows A-Z\n    * CNNVR\n  * Features\n    * Freedom Project\n    * Impact Your World\n    * Inside Africa\n    * 2 Degrees\n    * CNN Heroes\n    * All Features\n  * More\n    * Photos\n    * Longform\n    * Investigations\n    * CNN Profiles\n    * CNN Leadership\n    * CNN Newsletters\n    * Work for CNN\n\n* * *\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility & CC\n  * AdChoices\n  * About Us\n  * Modern Slavery Act Statement\n  * Advertise with us\n  * CNN Store\n  * Newsletters\n  * Transcripts\n  * License Footage\n  * CNN Newsource\n  * Sitemap\n\n© 2019 Cable News Network.Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.All Rights\nReserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.\n\n"

Anthony Gonzalez told CNN's Jake Tapper something over\nthe weekend that crystallized a question I keep coming back to when it comes\nto the Republican party's continuing loyalty to former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The cold hard truth is Donald Trump led us into a ditch on January 6,\"\nGonzalez, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for\nhis conduct on January 6, told Tapper. \"The former President lied to us. He\nlied to every one of us and in doing so he cost (Republicans) the House, the\nSenate and the White House.\"\n\nYes! This!\n\nPolitics has always been a bit of a rough game. Politicians who win -- and\nhelp others win -- are lauded. Those who don't, well, aren't. It's\ntransactional.\n\nThat reality is why I assumed that following Trump's 2020 loss, there would be\na significant reckoning within the party about the last four years -- and a\nturning away from Trump.\n\nRead More\n\nAfter all, that he oversaw -- and contributed to -- Republican losses is\nindisputable.\n\nIn 2018, Republicans lost 40 House seats -- and the House majority -- in an\nelection that Democrats successfully turned into a referendum on Trump. (That\nTrump's approval ratings was stuck in the low 40s in the run-up to that\nelection effectively sealed Republicans' fate.)\n\nTwo years later, Trump not only lost the presidency convincingly but also\nlikely cost Republicans their Senate majority by spending the months after the\nelection talking almost exclusively about (his lie of) how he was cheated out\nof victory. Democrats won two runoffs in Georgia while Trump was distracting\nthe party base and, in so doing, recaptured the Senate majority.\n\n**THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!**\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little\ndeeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nSo, Trump came into office in 2016 with Republicans in the majority in the\nHouse and Senate. He left office in 2020 with Republicans totally out of power\nin the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThat record of losses should -- if history was any guide -- leave such a\nstench of defeat around Trump that no one in the party would want to be around\nhim much less have him as their de facto leader.\n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nThe most obvious explanation for how Trump has managed to win despite losing\nis that he, well, never admits that he has lost.\n\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Trump tweeted that he had \"received so many\nCongratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night.\" Later he tweeted\nthat \"those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing\ncertain policies and principles, did very well.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 loss, Trump has spent months propagating the lie\nthat there was widespread voter fraud that cost him a win. (Note: There\nwasn't.)\n\nTrump's willingness to say up is down -- and for large parts of the Republican\nbase to take his word for it -- appears to have created an ahistoric moment\nfor the Republican party: They are following a man who oversaw widespread\nsetbacks for the party over the last four years. And more than that: They want\nhim to run for president again in 2024!\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * World\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * China\n    * Europe\n    * India\n    * Middle East\n    * United Kingdom\n  * US Politics\n    * The Biden Presidency\n    * Facts First\n    * US Elections\n  * Business\n    * Markets\n    * Tech\n    * Media\n    * Success\n    * Perspectives\n    * Videos\n  * Health\n    * Life, But Better\n    * Fitness\n    * Food\n    * Sleep\n    * Mindfulness\n    * Relationships\n  * Entertainment\n    * Stars\n    * Screen\n    * Binge\n    * Culture\n    * Media\n  * Tech\n    * Innovate\n    * Gadget\n    * Foreseeable Future\n    * Mission: Ahead\n    * Upstarts\n    * Work Transformed\n    * Innovative Cities\n  * Style\n    * Arts\n    * Design\n    * Fashion\n    * Architecture\n    * Luxury\n    * Beauty\n    * Video\n  * Travel\n    * Destinations\n    * Food and Drink\n    * Stay\n    * News\n    * Videos\n  * Sports\n    * Football\n    * Tennis\n    * Golf\n    * Tokyo 2020\n    * US Sports\n    * Climbing\n    * Motorsport\n    * Formula E\n    * Esports\n  * Videos\n    * Live TV \n    * Digital Studios\n    * CNN Films\n    * HLN\n    * TV Schedule\n    * TV Shows A-Z\n    * CNNVR\n  * Features\n    * As Equals\n    * Call to Earth\n    * Freedom Project\n    * Impact Your World\n    * Inside Africa\n    * 2 Degrees\n    * CNN Heroes\n    * All Features\n  * Weather\n    * Climate\n    * Storm Tracker\n    * Wildfire Tracker\n    * Video\n  * More\n    * Photos\n    * Longform\n    * Investigations\n    * CNN Profiles\n    * CNN Leadership\n    * CNN Newsletters\n    * Work for CNN\n\n* * *\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility & CC\n  * Ad Choices\n  * About Us\n  * Modern Slavery Act Statement\n  * Advertise with us\n  * CNN Store\n  * Newsletters\n  * Transcripts\n  * License Footage\n  * CNN Newsource\n  * Sitemap\n\n© 2021 Cable News Network.A Warner Media Company.All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans\n™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.\n\n"

Adam Schiff speaks during a media\nbriefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into\nPresident Trump, October 31, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) Time is not on\nAdam Schiff’s side.\n\nAdam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a\nsenatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the\nbrand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from\ntormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza,\nTrump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better\nthe optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity\nwhen Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after\nall, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically\ninert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation,\nfollowing the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill.\nOnce Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian\npresident Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard\nwhistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy\nleaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on\nthose who put him up to this present circus.\n\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his\nown presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the\ndeep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on\nthe presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their\ndishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own\ndoubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower.\nAfter previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the\nwhistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now\nups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower\nwill testify under oath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is\nas hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was\nnot familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that\nitself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\n\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special\nprosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a\nveritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to\nfind either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in\nthe 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and\n$35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or\nfindings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the\nentire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional\ntestimony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special\nprosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the\npost-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the\nMueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable\ncrimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-\npaid-for Christopher Steele.\n\nMost of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same\ncritical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that\nTrump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless\npolicy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that\nTrump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently\ntheir supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should\nsupersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United\nStates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were\nabjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be\nvirtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered\nthe Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when\nObama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took\nover as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange\nfor Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have\ntargeted his own morally compromised son.\n\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration\nthat at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping\nsanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out\nof the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO\ndefense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment\nof Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at\nthe Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first\nconsulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand\nknowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev?\nThe Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would\nthen have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in\nthe call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile\ndefense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama\nbefore the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians\nkeeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up\nto Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama?\nWould Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing\nthe American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no\nNixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term\npresident could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to\nabort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber\nimpeachment.\n\nDay-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news\nblackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the\n2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be\npresidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved\nperipheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of\nthe suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\n\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as\nit promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked\nof infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug\nprescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another\nof attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an\nincompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let\nhim ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\n\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and\ndominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get\nattention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and\ncrazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to\nElizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to\npay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators\nare trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\n\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of\nMichael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise\nJames Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative.\nHorowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well\nproceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the\nnation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a\nspecial counsel.\n\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the\npublic tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the\nElectoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment,\nthe Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns,\nrecession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage\nand celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump.\nIn other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets\nto Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already,\njust vote.”\n\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the\nmore the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears,\nand scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At\nsome point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public\nenemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In\nthe final scene from _Braveheart_ , the once-hated Scottish hero William\nWallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured\nbefore an English crowd\n\nthat’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-\nScottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\n\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long\npresidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family,\nbusinesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at\nwhat point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged\nvituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive\nenemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\n\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam\nSchiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes\nbefore the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the\nmore he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised.\nAnd the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\n\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his\nstaff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a\ncomplete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly\nsecret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one\nsees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including\nhis own party’s presidential candidates.\n\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the\ndebates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and\nDurham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking\ngun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just\nwants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his\ncareer as the icon of current progressivism.\n\nComments\n\nWhen Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “hearsay\ncan be much better evidence than direct” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks\ninto the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s\ntime to pack up the circus and leave town.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nComments\n\n#### Something to Consider\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.\nMembers get all of our content (including the magazine), no paywalls or\ncontent meters, an advertising-minimal experience, and unique access to our\nwriters and editors (conference calls, social-media groups, etc.).

But its lowered\nforecast isn’t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street.\nThat’s good news for investors.\n\nHome Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third\nquarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the\nstock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store\nsales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\n“Our third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business,\nyet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits\nassociated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said CEO Craig\nMenear in the company’s news release. “We are largely on track with these\ninvestments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits\nanticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial\nassumptions.”\n\nOne Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a “seamless,\ninterconnected shopping experience” for customers.\n\nIn a research report early Tuesday, **Jefferies** analyst **Jonathan\nMatuszewski** said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a\nbuying opportunity, according to the analyst. “Comp sales were light, though\noperating margins in-line with expectations,” wrote Matuszewski. “We interpret\nlighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on\nstrategic investments versus a softer macro picture.”\n\nHe’s not the only one who isn’t all that worried. **Wells Fargo** analyst\n**Zachary Fadem** points out a couple of additional reasons investors\nshouldn’t fret. “While certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the\ncompany] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains\ndeeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,” wrote Fadem in a Tuesday\nresearch report. “Excluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been\ncloser to 5%.”\n\nStill, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe’s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%.\nLowe’s reports earnings Wednesday.\n\nHome Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results\nwith analysts and investors.\n\nHome Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow\nJones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.\n\n**Write to** Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### Home Depot Stock Is Falling After Its Earnings Release.

It takes time and incredible discipline\nto earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it\nlooks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In\ngeneral, here are the steps you can take:\n\n## How to retire early\n\n### 1\\. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless\nyou want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live —\ni.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job\nfor something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps\nyou'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts\nand travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what\nthat phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it\neasier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n### 2\\. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from\nanesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early\nretiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the\nfuture,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net\nworth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be\nable to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking\naccount habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated\ntracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every\nyear.\"\n\n### 3\\. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how\nmuch money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between\n25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's\nworth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to\nAll the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to\ncalculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly,\nand even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are\nmultiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect\nyour investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help\nfind one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable\nplan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n### 4\\. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more\nthan you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to\nlive below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing,\ntransportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your\nsavings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three\ncategories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when\nsomeone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\"\nbudget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who\nachieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US\nhousehold, around $60,000 a year.\n\n### 5\\. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a\ncertain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an\neven bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali\nexplained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your\nexpenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term\nsolution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution,\nthey said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams.\nThe most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such\nas real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that\ngenerates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you\nmore flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial\nindependence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n### 6\\. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about\nfinancial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings.\nOftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax\nadvantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000\npretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax\ndeduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're\nplanning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able\nto take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59\nand a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with\nafter-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings\n— tax-free, at any time.\n\n### 7\\. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account.\nThis is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when\nyou need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren\nBuffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-\none investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to\ndiversify your money and minimize risk.\n\n_**Need help crunching the numbers? SmartAsset's free tool can help find a\nlicensed professional near you »**_\n\n### 8\\. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high\ninterest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good\nterms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-\nfree is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest\npayments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago\nat age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a\nsix-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living\nfrugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his\nbiggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free\ncertainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n### 9\\. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's\nhealth insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the\nmost cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is\njoining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer\nunder COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the\nAffordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting\na part-time job.\n\n### 10\\. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You\nmay find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go\nback to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would\nyou have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios\nis essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n### 11\\. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out.\nKeep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you\ncan.\n\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire,\n\"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not _all_ we do, either. It\nis important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those\nsmaller achievements.\"\n\n### Related coverage from How to Do Everything: Money:\n\n  * ### Here's exactly how to figure out when you can retire\n\n  * ### How to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth\n\n  * ### How to get COBRA health insurance if you lose your job or retire early\n\n  * ### How to invest in index funds, explained\n\nMehr: How to retire early Early retirement Retiring early Your Money Saving __\n\nPersonal Finance How To Personal Finance Insider pfi PFI-XAMP PFI SmartAsset\nRetirement\n\n  * __ facebook\n  * __ linkedin\n  * __ twitter\n  * __ email\n  * __ print\n\n# How to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nTanza Loudenback\n\nHow to retire early,Early retirement,Retiring early,Your Money Saving,Personal\nFinance How To,Personal Finance Insider,pfi,PFI-XAMP,PFI SmartAsset,Retirement\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\n2019-11-13T23:06:00+01:00\n\n2019-07-02T22:14:45+02:00\n\n2019-11-13T23:06:08+01:00\n\nhttps://static6.businessinsider.de/image/5d1ce1ae2516e9500e130fa8-500-250/how-\nto-retire-early-so-you-can-work-travel-and-relax-on-your-own-schedule.jpg\n\n500\n\n250\n\nBusinessInsiderDe\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.de/assets/images/logos/og-image-logo.png\n\nRetiring early takes time and incredible discipline.

In 2019, you can contribute\nup to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you\ncan get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return. The only caveat to\nstuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire\nearly is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money\nfrom your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You\ncan, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money,\nand withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at\nany time. 7\\. Invest the money that's left over If you're maxing out your\nretirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can\ninvest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it. Many early\nretirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's\nfavorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one\ninvestments that track a specific financial market and are designed to\ndiversify your money and minimize risk.

If\nyou have a mortgage, consider paying it off In preparing for early retirement,\neliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying\noff a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace\nof mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the\nmoney saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential\ninvestment returns. Tommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired\nnearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in\ntelecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving\nconsistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids,\nhe wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his\nmortgage before retiring. \"So much of our having a great retirement is mental.\nBeing mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n9\\. Research your options for health insurance Leaving a full-time employer\nalso means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're\nwaiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option\nfor health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's\nemployer-sponsored plan. Otherwise, you may consider continuing coverage\nthrough a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential\nsubsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-\nsharing plans; or getting a part-time job. 10\\. Make a backup plan No matter\nhow foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find\nyou hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to\nwork? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you\nhave room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is\nessential when your livelihood is on the line. 11\\. Put Plan A into action —\nbut enjoy the present, too Time and discipline are all you need to execute\nyour plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to\nlive in the present while you can.

If you're planning to\nretire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated\nannual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher\ndepending on the lifestyle you envision. Depending on how much you plan to\nspend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial\nindependence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. To\nachieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and\nmax out your retirement accounts. You should also aim to pay off all high-\ninterest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage\nearly. And don't forget to make a backup plan. Visit Business Insider's\nhomepage for more stories. The road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes\ntime and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you\npossibly can. That said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes\nand what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to\nget there. In general, here are the steps you can take: How to retire early\n1\\. Define early retirement Retiring early doesn't have to mean never earning\na paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not\nhaving to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to\nleave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your\nown hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing\nhobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between. The first step on the path\nto early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you.\nEstablishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just\nso you know, it will probably evolve over time. 2\\. Take inventory Leif\nDahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology\nat age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take\ninventory of their finances. \"There are two things you need to know in order\nto make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should\ncalculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\" \"The second\nthing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to\nguesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account\nhabits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking\nwith an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3\\. Establish your target number After outlining your version of early\nretirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a\nreality. Early retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests\nhaving between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or\ninvested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial\nFreedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares\nthe formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down\ninto monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals. This part may be difficult\nto calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to\nconsider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good\nfinancial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you\ncrunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your\ngoal — and even hold you accountable, if you want. 4\\. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more\nthan you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to\nlive below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing,\ntransportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your\nsavings rate. Depending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of\nthree categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is\nwhen someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\"\nbudget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who\nachieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person. Regular FIRE is someone\nwhose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a\nyear. 5\\. Leverage your income It's crucial to keep your spending in check,\nbut you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial\nplanner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing\nyour income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast\n\"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued\neffort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash\nflow is a long-term solution, they said. Sabatier encourages taking up a side\nhustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are\nthose that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book.\nBuilding a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to\ncover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the\nopportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote. 6\\. Max\nout your retirement accounts There's at least one common strategy present in\nnearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early\nand frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through\nretirement accounts. Employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide\nunparalleled tax advantages and investment growth.

At least one of the suspects was\nwearing an orange wig, KABC reported. CNN has reached out to the LAPD for more\ninformation.\n\nAlso Wednesday, police said at least four people stole $20,000 worth of\nmerchandise from an Apple store in Santa Rosa, which is located about 55 miles\nnorth of San Francisco.\n\n\"In a brazen daytime burglary in front of customers and staff, the suspects\ngrabbed over $20,000 worth of merchandise from the store and fled the area in\nan unknown vehicle,\" Santa Rosa police said in a statement.\n\nThe suspects were between the ages of 14 and 18 and wore masks, police said.\n\nThe thefts come amid a recent wave of \"smash-and-grab\" crimes.\n\nOn Monday, at least 18 people broke into the Nordstrom department store at the\nGrove in Los Angeles and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, LAPD Chief\nMichel Moore said. Three people were arrested, he said.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, a group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall\nin Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry\nstore before grabbing items and fleeing. And east of San Francisco, three\nsuspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob ransacked a Nordstrom\ndepartment store in Walnut Creek.\n\nIn suburban Chicago, 14 people barged into a Louis Vuitton store last week and\nfled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise.\n\n* * *\n\n© 2021 Cable News Network.
