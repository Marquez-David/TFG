          {"@context": "http://schema.org","@type": "NewsArticle","alternativeHeadline": "Mourinho agrees deal to become Tottenham manager","articleBody": "Jose Mourinho has agreed a deal to replace Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham's manager until the end of the 2022/23 season. Pochettino was sacked last night after five-and-a-half years in charge, and less than six months after leading Spurs to their first ever Champions League final. Negotiations between the London side and Mourinho's representatives intensified over the last few days, with talks continuing into Tuesday night. The Portuguese boss had been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United in December 2018. The 56-year-old said after his appointment: \"I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. \"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.\" Tottenham said in a statement: \"Jose is one of the world's most accomplished managers having won 25 senior trophies. \"He is renowned for his tactical prowess and has managed FC Porto, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United. \"He has won a domestic title in a record four different countries (Portugal, England, Italy and Spain) and is one of only three managers to have won the UEFA Champions League twice with two clubs, FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010.\" Tottenham posted an image of Mourinho holding up a Tottenham shirt from its Twitter account on Wednesday, with the caption: \"Welcome Jose\". Mourinho won three Premier League titles over two spells in charge of Chelsea and returned to England to manage Manchester United in 2016. He was sacked following a poor run of results and has been out of work since, most recently working as a pundit for Sky Sports. Mourinho, who also managed Porto, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, has turned down a number of opportunities to coach abroad, including with clubs in China, Spain and Portugal, since his Old Trafford exit. His first match in charge will be away to West Ham on Saturday.   Spurs have won just five matches this season and currently lie 14th in the table. Pochettino's sacking will reignite speculation about his future after the Argentine was previously linked to manager jobs at Manchester United and Real Madrid. It will also raise questions about the futures of some of Spurs' star players, including England captain Harry Kane, who have lauded Pochettino during his time at the club.
