(Manu Fernandez/AP)\n\n                  Associated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n                  Associated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n                      * \n\n              MADRID — Rafael Nadal kept Spain’s hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give the hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\n\n              Granollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5) to seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\n              The top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the series 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\n              \"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win, otherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a good position to advance.\"\n\n              Although only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight hours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court. Spain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia. Russia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\n              In the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.\n\n              \"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a position that you don’t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match, we were under pressure.\"\n\n              Serbia’s Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Andy Murray will make their first appearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the Netherlands.\n\n              The Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group co-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\n              Brazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also included a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd throughout the matches.\n\n              US FALLS\n\n              The United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after Vasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov defeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n              \"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well, served well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\n              The U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American neighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\n              FRANCE WINS\n\n              Two days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\n              Herbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\n              The French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis Cup runner-up.\n\n              The teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\n              Herbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n              \"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of confidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win but we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\n              ARGENTINA CRUISES\n\n              Argentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\n\n              The tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n              \"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\n\n              KAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\n              Kazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\n              The Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n              \"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\n              AUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\n              Australia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\n              Colombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\n                    More from Sportsnet\n                          Epic singles wins give Canada best Davis Cup Finals start imaginable\n                          Ryan McKenna\n                          Shapovalov, Pospisil give Canada a pair of upsets over Italy at Davis Cup\n                          Canadian Press\n\n                %2Ftennis%2Fargentina-comfortably-wins-davis-cup-opener-chile%2F\n              Join the Conversation\n                  When submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure of American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to influence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants sabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of the humanitarian convoy’s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened families wishing to leave the camp.”\n\n                        Source: Russian Defense Ministry, October 25, 2019\n                          False\n                            Information from multiple sources disputes the claims\n\n                      In a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria’s al-Tanf of controlling “bandit formations” and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\n\n                      The Pentagon rejected these accusations as “patently false,” and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\n\n                      The al-Tanf base\n\n                      The U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trump’s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\n\n                      The al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer “de-confliction zone” on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\n                      Iran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\n                      The U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\n                      The Rukban camp\n\n                      The Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria’s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country’s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\n\n                      According to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan’s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\n\n                      The population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\n\n                      Russia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n                      “U.S.-controlled bandit formations”\n\n                      The U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT – formerly the Free Syrian Army – to fight against Islamic State.\n\n                      Omar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\n\n                      Charles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University’s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry’s allegations are false.\n\n                      “I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not ‘control’ any actors there directly,” Simpson said. “From my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.”\n\n                      “… prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp”\n\n                      A VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim is “absolutely not true.”\n\n                      “Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,” the source said. “Many people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.”\n\n                      Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim “is patently false,” and that “the United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.”\n\n                      “Rukban is another example of the Assad regime’s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,” Robertson said.\n\n                      He added: “The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.”\n\n                      United Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is “working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.”\n\n                      Simpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n                      “Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,” Simpson said. “This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.”\n\n                      Robertson, the U.S. commander, said: “The United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.”\n\n                      Most popular\n\n                        * Most Viewed\n\n                                + 1\n\n                                  Phone Intercepts Suggest Russian Control Over Ukraine Separatists Ahead of Malaysia Airline Shootdown\n\n                                + 2\n\n                                  Russia and Syria: U.S.-backed Syrian Forces Blocking Refugee Return\n\n                                + 3\n\n                                  Transnistrian TV Spins Russian Expert’s Statement On Independence\n\n                                + 4\n\n                                  Hey Daily Mail: It’s 'Ki-yeev,' Not ‘KEEV’\n\n                                + 5\n\n                                  Russian Official: Extradition of Russian Hacker to U.S. Illegal -- False\n\n            Back to top\n              * Follow Us\n                    + \n                    + \n                    + \n                    + \n              * Info\n                    + About this project\n                    + Terms of Use\n                    + Contact Us\n                    + Newsletter\n                    + Vacancies\n\n          © 2019 POLYGRAPH.info All Rights Reserved.\n\n    XS\n    SM\n    MD\n    LG"

The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\n\n            In a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but “an articulated lorry crash” performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein’s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\n\n            “Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,” said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\n            “His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,” the expert warned.\n\n            The answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein’s “unbecoming” behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago – on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein’s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\n            But perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 – after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution – in order to terminate his friendship.\n\n            Andrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein’s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\n            During the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\n            He instead told the BBC interviewer: “I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.”\n\n            Oh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were “not close”.\n\n            His seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew’s otherwise “lack of remorse” or “sympathy” with the victims of Epstein’s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\n\n            Lawyers for Epstein’s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\n\n            It is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\n            It is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\n\n            Andrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\n\n            The former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let’s see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time.\n\n            The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.\n\n                ...\n                  Reddit\n                  Google+\n                  Blogger\n                  Pinterest\n                  StumbleUpon\n                  Telegram\n                  WhatsApp\n            553\n            Track\n            Do not trackCommunity standardsDiscussion\n            Comment via Facebook Comment via Sputnik\n                * Сomment\n                    * Post limit reached.

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\n\n        In a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\n\n        It was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\n          Trending News\n\n            * Video shows dramatic rescue of kidnapped girl: \"We got her!\"\n            * Man arrested after 7 trafficking victims found in car: Police\n            * Jeffrey Epstein jail guards charged with falsifying records\n            * White teen accused of plotting deadly attack on black church\n            * Safety officials urge Boeing to redesign part on 737s\n\n        Meanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\n\n        The video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\n        \"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\n\n        Following a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\n\n        According to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\n        The victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n        \"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\n\n        First published on November 19, 2019 / 8:16 AM\n\n        © 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.\n\n    In search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\n    The unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\n    Related: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through Time\n\n    TNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\n    \"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\n    The model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\n    \"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\n\n    The violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\n\n    That emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\n\n    Related: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe\n\n    As their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\n\n    Despite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n    \"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n\n      * 15 Amazing Images of Stars\n      * 11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way Galaxy\n      * The 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark Matter\n\n    Originally published on Live Science.\n\n    Need more space?

Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n\n        It’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\n\n        At the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\n        For the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\n\n        Audi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\n\n        Europe will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\n\n        Power and Performance\n\n        In Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\n        The US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\n        It’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\n\n        Quattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\n\n        Range and Charging\n\n        The e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\n        Still, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\n        For Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\n        Interior and Technology\n\n        Inside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\n        As with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\n        A Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\n\n        Natural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\n\n        Audi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\n        In Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\n        US pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\n\n            Story Timeline\n\n              * Audi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n              * 2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve\n\n          2020 Audi e-tron Sportback Gallery\n\n\n              * Facebook\n              * Twitter\n              * Reddit\n              * \n            Topics AudiEVLA Auto Show 2019luxury\n      Must Read Bits & Bytes\n\n      * Google Play Store needs more than AI to make app recommendations useful\n\n      * 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\n\n      * Pokemon Sword and Shield first impressions: My kingdom for a Bulbasaur\n\n      * Pokemon GO creators’ next big game: CATAN World Explorers\n\n      * Sony bets on artificial intelligence with new Sony AI global division\n\n        Site Information\n\n        About / Advertise / Tip Us / Contact\n\n        Policies\n\n        Editorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use\n\n        © 2005-2019 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.\n\n        Social and Media\n\n          * Facebook\n          * Twitter\n          * YouTube\n          * RSS Feed"

He didn’t get it. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n              Americans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor’s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n              “Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!” Trump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!”\n\n              Trump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.\n\n              “The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up and they’re going down.”\n\n              “You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”\n\n              Trump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.\n\n              It’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.\n\n              But just because no one\n\n              To start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that “President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”\n\n              Worried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.\n\n              But it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\n              I don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\n\n              The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Seeing it was a shot in the heart, how sad to see something like that,” the doctor said.\n\n                  Like this story?

It will house the local police force's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n                    \"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\" Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of civil servants, said in the statement.\n\n                    Architects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for the building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials will pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior Ministry said.\n\n                    Although Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that it was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938.\n\n                    Recent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also perpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's rule.\n\n                        Reuters"

The injury also forced him to miss both the French Open and U.S. Open in 2019.\n\n              “It is very hard and disappointing for me that I will not be able to represent my country at Davis Cup,” Raonic said in the statement. “My health has continued to let me down through this entire year and now once again. I will take the appropriate time to get healthy and I look forward to being back on court next season.”\n\n              “I believe in my teammates, and I know they’ll give everything to secure Canada’s first Davis Cup title. I’ll be following them very closely and I wish them the best.”\n\n              Raonic has only appeared for Canada in Davis Cup play since 2015 once, that being the 2018 World Group playoffs.\n\n              World No. 94 Brayden Schnur of Toronto will take Raonic’s place on the four-man team which includes world No. 15 Denis Shapovalov, No. 21 Auger-Aliassime, and No. 149 Vasek Pospisil.\n\n              “I’m very happy to be able to play in the Davis Cup Finals but, of course, I first want to wish Milos a speedy recovery,” said Schnur in the Tennis Canada statement. “It’s an honour for me to represent Canada in this team competition. We know every win will be hard-won but I’m ready to support my teammates and go all the way.”\n\n              Schnur reached his first ATP Tour final as a qualifier in February at the New York Open, losing in a third set tiebreak to Reilly Opelka. He also reached three ATP Challenger Tour finals in 2019, most recently falling to his new Davis Cup teammate Pospisil in Charlottesville two weeks ago.\n\n              It will be the Toronto-native’s second appearance for Canada at the Davis Cup. He lost both his singles matches in the 2017 World Group Playoffs against India, although Canada won the tie.\n\n              Auger-Aliassime and Pospisil have also suffered injuries in the last month, but both are still expected to play next week.\n\n              The Davis Cup Finals will take place from Nov. 18 to 24 at the Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain. Canada is in a group with the United States and Italy in the 18 team tournament.\n\n                    More from Sportsnet\n                          Nadal, Djokovic playing for year-end No. 1 ranking in ATP Finals\n                          Pete Borkowski\n                          Denis Shapovalov seeing results from footwork adjustment\n                          Canadian Press\n                  When submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

It is up to them to de-escalate, as others should tell them\n\n            Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.54 GMT Last modified on Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.56 GMT\n\n                * Share on Facebook\n                * Share on Twitter\n                * Share via Email\n\n        ‘Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement.’ Photograph: AFP via Getty\n\n          H ong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is “absolutely no room for compromise”. But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\n\n          As the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message – no way out – was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong’s legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched “save the students” marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\n\n          Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\n\n          Though many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong’s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People’s Liberation Army took to the city’s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a “voluntary clean-up activity” which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\n\n          The movement’s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to “show absolutely no mercy” in the “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the “Belfastisation” of the city.\n\n          Further afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing’s chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year’s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\n\n          China’s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible – but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\n\n            Topics\n                * Hong Kong\n                * Opinion\n                * Protest\n                * Asia Pacific\n                * Communism\n                * Xi Jinping\n                * China\n                * editorials\n                * Share on Facebook\n                * Share on Twitter\n                * Share via Email\n                * Share on LinkedIn\n                * Share on Pinterest\n                * Share on WhatsApp\n                * Share on Messenger\n                * Reuse this content\n\n        Most popular\n\n        * The Guardian view\n        * Columnists\n        * Cartoons\n        * Opinion videos\n        * Letters\n      * News\n      * Opinion\n      * Sport\n      * Culture\n      * Lifestyle\n        * Contact us\n        * Complaints & corrections\n        * SecureDrop\n        * Work for us\n        * Privacy policy\n        * Cookie policy\n        * Terms & conditions\n        * Help\n        * All topics\n        * All writers\n        * Digital newspaper archive\n        * Facebook\n        * Twitter\n        * Advertise with us\n        * Search UK jobs\n        * Dating\n        * Discount Codes\n            Support The Guardian\n            Available for everyone, funded by readers\n        Contribute Subscribe\n    Back to top\n      © 2019 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This year we saw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple impresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech companies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\n\n                          Also: See Black Friday coverage at CNET\n\n                          Surely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along with the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to keep on an eye out for the best deals.\n\n                          Some of 2019's best tech gadgets\n\n                          Disclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.\n\n                          Jason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n                          Apple AirPods Pro for $235\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          Since the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been asking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple finally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new design sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments, and comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\n                          Nintendo\n\n                          Nintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          The smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into a dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The screen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently attached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch that users love and embrace.\n\n                          Sonos\n\n                          Sonos Move for $400\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          Sonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment speakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable. With Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest of its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\n\n                          Amazon\n\n                          Amazon Echo Buds for $130\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          In many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have been well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds have Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and Android devices.\n\n                          Apple iPhone 11 Pro.\n\n                          Apple, Inc.\n\n                          Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\n                            * See it now: Apple\n\n                          The iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what it did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an amazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that battery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get this year.\n\n                          Jason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n                          Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\n                            * See it now: Samsung\n\n                          Arguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed, has a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep up with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your creativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\n\n                          DJI\n\n                          DJI Mavic Mini for $399\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          The Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package. With a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to believe it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and enthusiasts who love shiny new things.\n\n                          Fossil\n\n                          Fossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\n\n                            * See it now: Fossil\n\n                          The Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a normal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient display that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your connected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\n\n                          Wyze\n\n                          Wyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\n\n                            * See it now: Wyze\n\n                          Know when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway with the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to connect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\n\n                          Amazon\n\n                          Amazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          One of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The new Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to the side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control connected devices, ask questions or play music.\n\n                          Ring\n\n                          Ring Indoor Cam for $60\n\n                            * See it now: Amazon\n\n                          Ring security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been made primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and capable of helping you monitor your home.\n\n                          Let's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into a shortlist is hard.

He also agreed to return the cash he received from the use of “We.”\n\n          A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\n          WeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology investment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch. SoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to fund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for some of Neumann’s shares.\n\n          WeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later this week in areas that do not support WeWork’s core business goals, said The We Company’s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\n          The New York Times reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000 jobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.\n\n          Next steps to shape the company’s future will be divulged in an all-company meeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\n          He said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization to grow. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities,” added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\n          An October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWork’s venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units.\n\n          This is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The company rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\n\n          Bloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as it sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\n\n          WeWork’s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on Monday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n\n          (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with reporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell.)\n\n      Most Read\n\n        * Brookings: AI will heavily affect tech and white-collar jobs\n        * Hearthstone: Battlegrounds gets four new heroes in big update\n        * Why 'The Mandalorian' cites Fortnite dev Epic Games in its credits\n        * Qualcomm: 5G will cover major metros in 2020, developing countries in 2021\n        * Clumio raises $135 million for cloud data backup and recovery tools\n\n      UPCOMING EVENTS\n\n        * GamesBeat Summit Apr. 28-29\n        * Transform Jul. 15-16"

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\n\n              Chris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31 pm CST\n        0\n\n        Volkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t expected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.\n\n        You could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe.\n\n        The MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower.\n\n        A 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\n        However, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph.\n\n        As for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle.\n\n        Helping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\n        Door handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\n        Turbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo.\n\n        All those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they’re eyes opening.\n\n        Inside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\n        The dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\n\n        Even the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too.\n\n        In a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost effective.\n\n            Story Timeline\n\n              * 2020 VW ID.3 official as Volkswagen bets on electric\n              * As VW ID.3 production begins, Volkswagen bets it all on an electric future\n\n          VW ID.

His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 14, according to the office release.\n\n                    U.S. Attorney James Kennedy Jr. said in the release this case demonstrates that free speech does not protect people to “make threats to harm lawmakers simply because they may disagree with them.”\n\n                        ADVERTISEMENT\n\n                    Sonya A. Zoghlin, Carlineo’s attorney, told The Hill in a statement that her client did not intend to cause harm to Omar and did not make plans to do so.\n\n                    “Pat Carlineo is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to express them,” she said in an email. “He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this instance.”\n\n                    Carlineo was arrested in April for a March 21 phone call he reportedly made to Omar’s office, in which he said he’d put a “bullet in her f---ing skull.”\n\n                    The office referred the call to U.S. Capitol Police, who worked with the FBI to investigate. When Carlineo was approached, he told police he supported Trump and hates radical Muslims in government.\n\n                    Rep.

Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\n        Morrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he wasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\n\n        Republicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\n\n          Trump Impeachment Inquiry More\n\n            * Watch live: Sondland testifies about Ukraine at pivotal impeachment hearing\n            * Key moments from Kurt Volker's and Tim Morrison's testimony\n            * 7 key moments from Tuesday's first impeachment hearing\n            * Volker says he didn't realize link between Ukraine investigations and Bidens\n            * White House aides testify about \"unusual,\" \"improper\" Ukraine call at hearing\n\n          More in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\n        Here are some of the highlights:\n\n         1. \"My fears have been realized\"\n\n        Day 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison's opening statement\n\n        Morrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.\"\n\n        He begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n        2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\n        Volker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\n        \"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"\n\n        Volker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\n\n        \"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.\n\n        3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\n        Volker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at \"three amigos\" references\n\n        Volker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\n        He denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\n        Volker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"\n\n        4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\n        Morrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\n\n        Republican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\n        Morrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.\n\n        Morrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\n\n        \"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\n        Morrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n        5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\n        Volker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\n        \"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\n        Volker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n        \"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\n\n        6. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\n        Tim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\n\n        Morrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n        7. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\n        Volker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n        \"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n        \"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\n        First published on November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n\n        © 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

But because users hide behind virtual profiles, it's easy to ghost, harass, and view others as non-human — and now that bots are populating these platforms, some actually are. As the industry continues to grow, some experts question whether dating app companies are really interested in helping people find love, or if they have an incentive to keep people in an endless cycle of searching and matching without any real connection.\n\n                        Nov 7 23:05\n\n                      How impeachment impacts 2020\n\n                      Between Tuesday's hearings, Senate leaders from both parties provided a preview on how an impeachment trial could play out in the coming months.

Canada beat Costa Rica and Mexico in Edmonton earlier this month to vault to the top of the Concacaf standings after eight games.\n\n              While playing indoors at Vancouver’s BC Place was considered for the Jan. 30 fixture, it would have caused a far tougher travel schedule for Canada.\n\n              The Canadians are in Honduras on Jan. 27 and in El Salvador on Feb. 2.\n\n              The Americans opted for cold-weather venues to be sandwiched around their trip to Canada. They’ll face El Salvador on Jan. 27 in Columbus, Ohio and Honudras on Feb. 2 in St. Paul, Minn.\n\n              Canada played its first three home World Cup qualifiers on grass at BMO Field in Toronto before shifting to artificial turf for Edmonton and now Hamilton.\n\n              Canada has four road games and two home games left.\n\n              The Canadians are one point up on the U.S. and two ahead of Mexico and Panama.\n\n              The top three teams earn direct entries into the 2022 World Cup.\n\n              The U.S.-Canada game adds another big event to the Tim Hortons Field schedule. The Hamilton field hosts the Canadian Premier League final on Dec. 5, the Grey Cup on Dec. 12 and the Tim Hortons Heritage Classic outdoor NHL game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Buffalo Sabres on March 13.\n\n              Forge FC of the CPL and the CFL’s Hamilton Tiger-Cats call Tim Hortons Field home.\n\n              Forge FC has won the first two CPL titles and will host Pacific FC in the 2021 final.\n\n              The Ticats host the Montreal Alouettes in the CFL East semifinal on Sunday.\n\n                    More from Sportsnet\n                          Bundle up: U.S. to play next World Cup qualifiers in Columbus, St. Paul\n                          Sportsnet Staff\n                          A year to go, Qatar World Cup still feels heat of scrutiny\n                          Associated Press\n                  When submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

        "texto": "    Welcome to The Detroit News’s EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE\n\n    Learn More\n\n        Thousands of teachers pack Indiana Statehouse for protest\n\n            Tom Davies Associated Press\n            Published 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\n        Indianapolis – Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the Republican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half of the state’s school districts for the day.\n\n        The union-organized rally represented Indiana’s biggest such teacher protest amid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.\n\n              Indiana teachers wearing red have carry signs as they hold rally at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, calling for further increasing teacher pay in the biggest such protest in the state amid a wave of educator activism across the country.\n              Michael Conroy, AP\n\n        Teachers chanted, “Fund our schools,” and “Put kids first,” as hundreds of them lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with sayings such as, “Less Money on Testing, More Money on Students.” Teachers with marching band instruments played “We’re Not Gonna Take It” from the Statehouse steps.\n\n        High school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow teachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m. for the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n\n        “We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n\n        Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n        “The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n\n        Nearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\n        Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\n        Other teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\n\n        While some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\n        Bosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n\n        “We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned about issues.”\n\n        Teachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n\n        The governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\n        Education advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\n\n        McCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren’t “asking for the moon.”\n\n        “What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n\n        Joel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said politicians have “vilified” educators.\n\n        “They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we’re in the classroom.”\n\n          Published 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\n\n    Terms of Service Privacy Notice\n    © The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper"

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\n                James Van Der Beek has been eliminated from “Dancing with the Stars.”\n\n                The former “Dawson’s Creek” star, 42, was voted off the popular dance competition on Monday in a tight race against singer Ally Brooke after performing two dances for judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba.\n\n                Van Der Beek was eliminated in what host Tom Bergeron described as the “hardest judge’s verdict so far this season.” The difficult elimination came in light of Van Der Beek’s announcement that his wife, Kimberly, had suffered a miscarriage over the weekend.\n\n                'DANCING WITH THE STARS' CARRIE ANN INABA OPENS UP ABOUT SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION\n\n                Van Der Beek revealed the news of the miscarriage in a video package earlier in the episode, noting that he and Kimberly experienced every parent’s “worst nightmare.”\n\n                “My wife Kimberly and I went through every expecting parent’s worst nightmare. We lost the baby,” Van Der Beek said. “The little soul that we had expected to welcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond.”\n\n                “You never know why these things happen, that’s what I’ve been telling my kids. All you know is that it brings you closer together, it breaks you open, it opens your heart, it deepens your appreciation,” said the actor. “It makes you more human.”\n\n                SEAN SPICER ELIMINATED FROM 'DANCING WITH THE STARS'\n\n                The news of the miscarriage came a month after Van Der Beek announced that Kimberly was expecting on a previous episode of “DWTS.”\n\n                The actor shared a clip of his wife getting her first ultrasound with their other children in attendance.\n\n                \"Hearing the heartbeat was something we never take for granted,\" the \"Pose\" actor previously said on \"DWTS.\" His wife has suffered several miscarriages in the past.\n\n                'DANCING WITH THE STARS': LAUREN ALAINA IS CHANNELING HER BREAKUP ENERGY INTO COMPETITION SERIES\n\n                In his initial Instagram announcement of the pregnancy, Van Der Beek even touched upon the idea of miscarriage and noted there should be “zero shame” involved.\n\n                \"@Vanderkimberly and I have been through three of those first appointments to discover either no heartbeat, or no baby, and she wanted to share this moment. Miscarriage (a word that needs a replacement – nobody failed to 'carry', these things sometimes just happen) is something that people rarely talk about, and often go through in secret.\n\n                \"But there needs to be zero shame around it, or around giving yourself the time and space to grieve. We decided to put ourselves out there – not knowing what we’d find – in an effort to chip away at any senseless stigma around this experience and to encourage people who might be going through it to open themselves up to love & support from friends and family when they need it most.\"\n\n                LAUREN ALAINA SAYS 'DWTS' HAS HELPED HER LOSE 25 POUNDS\n\n                Those involved with “DWTS” struggled with the decision to boot Van Der Beek off the show.\n\n                “This is not easy.

Of the total participants who filled in The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half were female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9 percent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or ethnicity.\n\n              The team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by 2016—Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon— and noted if and how often respondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis use disorder before a nd after the laws were enacted.\n\n                      Related Stories\n                      * Dangers of Vaping : Facts and Statistics on Health Risks of E-Cigarettes\n                      * Cannabis Could Ease Symptoms of Depression in PTSD Patients\n                      * These Are the Industries Where Staff Are Most Likely to Smoke Weed\n\n              Cannabis use disorder is where a person's use of the drug negatively affects their life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use so much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and spend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\n\n              In adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the past month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use isn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent to 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\n\n              The number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use disorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group in other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\n\n              But among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis use in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\n\n                A stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the relationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug. Getty\n\n              Marijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause substantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to physical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment, decline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.\n\n              Senior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use disorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic and social consequences.\n\n                Neil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\n                  Read more\n\n              \"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts should coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be informed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make informed decisions,\" Martins said.\n\n              Ian Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of Health Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: \"Although the researchers found that regular use increased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate to a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis. Even a small percentage increase in regular cannabis users can increase the risk of developing problems like cannabis dependence which services would be unlikely to have the capacity to support.\"\n\n              This graphic, provided by Statista, shows the U.S. states where recreational marijuana has been legalized.\n\n                U.S. states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational and/or medical use. Statista\n\n              However, he pointed out it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from observational studies such as this one. The researchers weren't, for instance, able to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used, \"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently which wouldn't create the same degree of risk as those using high potency cannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.\n\n              Hamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers and manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health benefits, and even basic information on strength.\n\n              \"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely risk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at risk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time it is often too late,\" Hamilton said.\n\n              But he said the results also don't mean cannabis shouldn't be legalized, rather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support services need to be adequately funded and available, something other states and countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis policies.\"\n\n              Request Reprint & Licensing, Submit Correction or view Editorial Guidelines\n            Cannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal | Health\n              Sign up for our Newsletter\n            Sign up\n            Update your preferences »\n            Choose a Membership That's Perfect for You!\n\n              Print & Digital\n\n                Weekly magazine, delivered\n                Daily Newsletter\n                Website access\n\n                Subscribe\n\n              Print Only\n\n                Weekly magazine, delivered\n                Daily Newsletter\n                Website access\n\n                Subscribe\n\n              Digital Only\n\n                Free access to 40+ digital editions\n                Website access\n                Daily Newsletter\n\n                Subscribe\n\n        © 2019 Newsweek\n\n        * \n        * \n        * \n        * \n        * \n            * About Us\n            * Corrections\n            * Contact Us\n            * Editorial Guidelines\n            * Advertise\n            * Copyright\n            * Terms & Conditions\n            * Privacy Policy\n            * Cookie Policy\n            * Terms of Sale\n            * Archive\n            * Announcements\n          Consent preferences\n          Editions:\n            * U.S. Edition\n            * 日本\n            * 한국\n            * Pakistan\n            * Polska\n            * România"

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\n                                            Browns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\n                                            Richardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\n                                            CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\n\n                                            While Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\n                                            \"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\n                                            The Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\n\n                                            \"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\n                                            Pick Six Newsletter\n\n                                            Get the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks and power rankings.\n\n                                            I agree that CBS Sports can send me the \"Pick Six Newsletter\" newsletter.\n\n                                              See All Newsletters\n                                            Please check the opt-in box to acknowledge that you would like to subscribe.\n\n                                            Thanks for signing up!\n\n                                            Keep an eye on your inbox for the latest sports news.\n\n                                            Sorry!\n\n                                            There was an error processing your subscription.\n\n                            2019 NFL Playoff Picture\n\n                                  * NFL Scores | Expert Picks | Odds\n                                  * 2019 NFL playoff picture | Standings\n\n                              Join our Free $1,000,000 Parlay Challenge\n\n                                Play Now\n                            Our Latest Stories\n\n                              * Gronk, Serena perform with Laker Girls\n\n                                Gronk may have found his true calling\n\n                              * NFL odds, cheat sheet, picks, bets, sims\n\n                                SportsLine's computer model simulated every Week 12 NFL game 10,000 times with surprising results.\n\n                              * Jones tells Belichick story from '90s\n\n                                The Cowboys owner actually might've had a chance to hire Belichick before he went to New England\n\n                              * NFL office pool picks for Week 12\n\n                                SportsLine's advanced computer just locked in its Week 12 NFL office pool picks.\n\n                              * Pats place Olszewski on IR\n\n                                New England's roster is re-shuffling\n\n                              * Playoff picture: Raiders in pursuit\n\n                                Breaking down the 2019 NFL playoff picture after Sunday's Week 11 action\n\n                              * Chiefs vs. Chargers: Recap, highlights\n\n                                Kansas City has held on to their lead in the AFC West\n\n                              * Rams top Bears as offenses struggle\n\n                                Neither the Rams nor Bears could get much going offensively on Sunday night\n\n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * Help\n      * About Us\n      * Careers\n      * Advertise\n      * Site Map\n      * Newsletters\n      * Mobile Apps\n      * College Network\n      * Ad Choice\n      * Closed Captioning\n      * Privacy\n      * Terms\n      * Mobile User Agreement\n        SportsLine.com\n\n    © 2004-2019 CBS Interactive.

All but four have now been released.\n\n                Plague can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if not treated promptly.\n\n                The last major known outbreak in China was in 2009, when several people died in the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n                In May this year, travellers were left stranded in Mongolia after an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague killed a couple after they ate an infected Marmot.\n\n                          Most read in world news\n\n                              RANDY ANDY\n\n                              Andrew parties in unearthed pics despite claiming 'he avoids PDAs & can't sweat'\n\n                              TIME TRAVELLER\n\n                              Conspiracy theorists say they've spotted Greta Thunberg in 120-year-old pic\n\n                              ‘NAÏVE AND TRUSTING’\n\n                              Grace Millane ‘gave man on BDSM site list of kinky sex fetishes’\n                                  Warning\n\n                              EYE POPPING\n\n                              Russian Popeye has 'rotting' tricep removed after injecting oil to look muscly\n\n                              ‘GET WITH THE PROGRAM’\n\n                              Furious mum demands kids clothes have gender labels scrapped\n\n                              DRIVEN TO SUICIDE\n\n                              Pregnant girl, 13, 'jumps to her death after she's gang raped by 6 men'\n\n                Authorities in western Mongolia, which is close to the Russian frontier, instituted a quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\n                American, Dutch, German, Swedish, Swiss, and South Korean tourists were marooned in Uglii as a result.\n\n                    How is the plague spread?\n\n                    Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis - a bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\n                    Those infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubaction period of one-to-seven days, says the World Health Organization.\n\n                    Symptoms include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, along with weakness and vomiting.\n\n                    The two main forms of plague infection are bubonic and pneumonic - where bubonic plague has spread to the lungs.\n\n                    Bubonic is the most common form and is where people develop painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes'.\n\n                    At advanced stages of the infection, inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus.\n\n                    Plague is transmitted between animals and humans; by the bite of infected fleas; direct contact with infected tissues; and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\n\n                    Those suffering from bubonic plague have a 30-60 per cent chance of dying from the disease.\n\n                    Untreated pneumonic plague is \"always fatal\", says WHO.\n\n                    From 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.\n\n                    Historically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality.\n\n                    It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe.\n\n                    Nowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics.\n\n                Researchers have pinpointed the earliest evidence of the deadly illness to a placed called Laishevo in Russia\n\n                    6\n\n                The city of Uglii was closed earlier this year due to some plague-contaminated marmots Credit: Vesti/The Siberian Times\n\n                    6\n\n                A couple in Mongolia in May 2019 who died are suspected to have eaten a Marmot - a large rodent Credit: The Siberian Times\n\n                    6\n\n                Officials were seen in Mongolia attempting to control the potential spread of the plague Credit: The Siberian Times\n\n                    6\n\n                Fears of contamination broke out after a husband and wife died from the deadly plague in Mongolia, in May Credit: The Siberian Times\n\n                    * \n                    * \n                  Topics\n                  * Health\n                  * China\n                    Comments are subject to our community guidelines, which can be viewed here.\n\n            Popular Articles\n\n                SCORCHER\n\n                Dec takes baby Isla for walk in the Oz sunshine after revealing burn from dad duty\n\n                WHO'S THE DADDY?\n\n                Emmerdale fans stunned as paedo teacher Maya is revealed to be PREGNANT\n\n                Lett it be\n\n                Scarlett Moffatt insists Saturday Night Takeaway 'will be amazing' after axe\n\n                BREAK THE ICE\n\n                Mum's speedy hack to get frost off your windscreen is hailed a 'game-changer'\n\n                spice girl forever\n\n                Romeo Beckham posts video of mum Victoria dancing to Spice Up Your Life\n\n                  Comment\n\n                FAT CHANCE\n\n                There's NO excuse for sending your kids to school with cold McDonald's\n\n                ANDY'S RICHES\n\n                Andrew lives billionaire's life on £270k - so where does he get all his cash?\n\n                DON'T CROSS DAD\n\n                Peter Andre reveals he took away Princess' phone after she got detention\n\n                  Exclusive\n\n                RAG 'N' ALONE MAN\n\n                Rag 'n' Bone Man splits from wife just six months after tracksuit wedding\n\n                SOAP-ER STARS\n\n                I'm A Celeb newbies Andrew Whyment and Cliff Parisi prepare to join the camp\n\n        Follow The Sun\n\n        Services\n\n          * Sign Up To The Sun\n          * About Us\n          * Editorial Complaints\n          * Clarifications and Corrections\n          * News Licensing\n          * Advertising\n          * Contact Us\n          * Commissioning Terms\n          * Help Hub\n          * Topic A-Z\n          * Cookie Settings\n          * Contact Preferences\n\n          This feature allows The Sun to personalise your experience so that you get the most out of your visit.

Instead, they lost 24-17.\n\n      “We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,” Lynn said, via the Los Angeles Times. “Yes, we needed to win this game today. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could control our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still think we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are going to need some help.”\n\n      At 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would probably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve played so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning records, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The Chargers needed to win that game.\n\n          Share this:\n\n              * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n              * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n              * Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n              * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n              * \n      Permalink 34 Comments Feed for comments Back to top\n\n        34 responses to “ Anthony Lynn: “We needed to win this game” ”\n\n           1. thelastchargersfan says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 6:34 am\n\n              It’s a good thing we have no fans left because this is a dumpster fire.\n\n           2. joetoronto says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 6:44 am\n\n              It’s time for both Chargers fans to come to grips with reality, it’s over yet again.\n\n           3. theprocess12 says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 6:58 am\n\n              As usual too many mistakes by Rivers. As good as the class of 2004 QBs have been one of them always leads in INTs. With Hill out the KC offense doesn’t look that dynamic against a decent D. Don’t see how they can win 2 road playoff games.\n\n           4. v2787 says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 7:02 am\n\n              Rivers is done. Get a new QB, Chargers. Philip has hit the wall. You’ve got a good team, but you need a QB who won’t throw interceptions. That “shot put” style of passing that Rivers has isn’t working anymore.\n\n           5. 4hourelection says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 7:06 am\n\n              Feckless Chargers.

MortimerInMiami says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 7:23 am\n\n              Chargers are on the clock!\n\n           8. sammievee says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 7:42 am\n\n              If you needed to win, understand that teams that needlessly spike the ball in final minute, giving up a valuable play while letting a beaten fatigued defense off the hook, usually loses that game. Instead, consider doing what legit teams do–practice during the week while preparing a play just for that situation. Then come up to the line of scrimmage and execute the play as you are not going to get a better chance than you had on first down with 24 seconds left and the opposing defense in utter disarray. Reid was choking again with the game management, I think I saw him doing high fives when Rivers spiked the ball and instantly turning the odds of scoring on that drive from 80% to 15% with that decision to spike the ball in that situation.\n\n           9. mroklahoma says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 8:13 am\n\n              What’s he supposed to say?\n\n          10. 6ringsandarapist says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 8:32 am\n\n              Did anyone really think the Chargers would win?\n\n          11. lonespeed says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\n              Philip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback. He looked as if he was projecting outward confidence, but he didn’t seem to have confidence in his ability. Kinda like when you get tired at the end of a long golf round. It started to manifest itself in mental errors and forced throws that weren’t crisp. Lots of batted balls and throws behind his targets. He might still be able to win a handful of games, but his days of leading a team to the playoffs are over. My guess is he retires at the end of this season.\n\n          12. theguiceisright says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 8:53 am\n\n              “Yes, I need to bench Rivers”*\n\n              I actually don’t think Tyrod is that bad, plus he looks pretty sweet in a chargers uniform\n\n          13. C.

With Gordon & Ekeler, it makes you wonder why the Chargers didn’t do the same. Poor game plan?\n\n              Rivers is no longer a QB that can carry a team with his arm but they still think he is.\n\n          16. shutupbrees says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\n              two weeks in a row the Chargers run for over 5.0 yards per carry, but insist on letting Philip Rivers drop back 50+ times. He seems like a good guy, but he’s done. He spends more time barking it up with opponents than any QB I’ve seen. It’d be funny if he wasn’t abysmal in the 2 minute drill throwing arm punt after arm punt.\n\n          17. Bob.

The Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC defense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they have a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in desperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of the year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can do, though Spanos will mess it up.\n\n          20. jbaxt says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\n              Two things… Why would you stop running Gordon?\n\n              Also, several “experts” picked the Chargers to win the AFC West.\n\n          21. devindenv says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 10:41 am\n\n              Chiefs Offense, without Hill, isn’t as dymnamic – as the poster above stated. Is that any f-ing surprise? But to say they cannot win 2 road playoff games overlooks the fact that the O-line. last night, was the first time in 6 weeks they have Eric Fisher back and the starting LG was back for the first time 3-4 weeks. Furthermore, tey are still down their best CB and a starting DE. The Bye week comes at a great time for them. We shall see as they have OAK in Week 13 and the Patriots in Week 14.\n\n          22. fartweasel says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 11:32 am\n\n              Rivers is done. He just hasn’t accepted it yet. Great career, but his skills have diminished. Time to retire.\n\n          23. patsfan4lifesbchamps says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\n              Anthony Lynn is in over his head\n\n          24. psi0016000 says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 11:46 am\n\n              The Chargers should sign Kapernick and make him the starter for the WHOLE 2020 season. In doing so, they will put and end to this ridiculous saga between Kaper and the NFL, where both sides are at fault.\n              This will also make possible, the transition from a declining and pathetic would be Hall of Famer, to a long time ago Super Bowl Runner up. Who knows …\n              And then they should make a priority of ending up the 2020 draft, and 2020 free agency, with a boat load of OL, some of them being outright homeruns.\n\n              One last note : hire Dan Fouts as an assistant QB coach.\n\n              How about them Chargers !!!!\n\n          25. Why I Love Football says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\n              “Their going to need help along the way” ? … Man, the Chargers are going to need someone like Moses to lead them to the playoffs. I think Coach Lynn needed this win more than anyone in order to stay employed. Chargers and Bears are in a league of their own. They are stuck with no where to go.\n\n          26. smarter than you says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 12:07 pm\n\n              What a worthless team, no history, no tradition, ugly uniforms, I’d rather be a Bengals fan\n\n          27. averagjoe says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\n\n              The look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should end all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n\n          28. grumpysal says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 12:39 pm\n\n              Watching last night’s game was like i was re-watching their game from a few weeks ago (?) where Rivers basically did the same thing (INT on last play) – I wondered during that game why the OC didn’t run the ball more and again last night.\n\n              After being IN that game a few weeks ago, did the Chargers coaches think a different outcome was going to happen? I mean, do they even watch Rivers during the game? He was downright awful.\n\n          29. MightyMidwest says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 1:18 pm\n\n              Might as well take your ball & go to Sacramento, San Diego, Portland or wherever.\n\n              Maybe Mexico City is an option?\n\n          30. cafetero1075 says:\n              November 19, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\n              Rivers has had bad seasons and bounced back.

Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying finished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's tournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for Ryan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the semifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro 2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n                                            Here's what to know:\n\n                                            There's still a chance for these teams\n\n                                            As it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a spot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each path having one berth:\n\n                                            Path A: Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\n                                            Path B: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland\n                                            Path C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\n                                            Path D: Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus\n\n                                            *A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.\n\n                                            Four teams from there will join the field of 20.\n\n                                            Clinching in November\n\n                                            On Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at Ireland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before, Portugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and Cristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one shot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories out of eight in all competitions.\n\n                                            Croatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia secured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout of Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern Ireland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\n\n                                            On Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against Liechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\n\n                                            And earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot, and that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with the reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites. Below are all the teams that qualified for the tournament during the group stage.\n\n                                            Qualified teams\n\n                                              * England (Group A): 10th appearance\n                                              * Czech Republic (Group A): Seventh appearance\n                                              * Ukraine (Group B): Third appearance\n                                              * Spain (Group F): 11th appearance\n                                              * Sweden (Group F): Seventh appearance\n                                              * Poland (Group G): Fourth appearance\n                                              * France (Group H): 10th appearance\n                                              * Turkey (Group H): Fifth appearance\n                                              * Belgium (Group I): Sixth appearance\n                                              * Russia (Group I): 12th appearance\n                                              * Italy (Group J): 10th appearance\n                                              * Finland (Group J): Zero appearances\n                                              * Croatia (Group E): Sixth appearance\n                                              * Austria (Group G): Third appearance\n                                              * Netherlands (Group C): 10th appearance\n                                              * Germany (Group C): 13th appearance\n                                              * Switzerland (Group D): Fifth appearance\n                                              * Denmark (Group D): Ninth appearance\n                                              * Portugal (Group B): Eighth appearance\n                                              * Wales (Group E): Second appearance\n\n                                              Roger Gonzalez\n                                                CBS Sports Writer\n                                          follow\n\n                                            Roger Gonzalez is an award-winning writer based in Virginia that has covered pro soccer from Europe's top clubs to Argentina's first division.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\n                    Photo: David Zalubowski, STF / Associated Press\n                    New car sales plunge 10 percent in October\n                      1 / 9\n                      Back to Gallery\n\n        New vehicle sales in the Houston area plunged 10 percent last month, despite low interest rates and clearance deals.\n\n        Local auto dealers sold 30,154 new cars, trucks and SUVs in October, the second-highest sales volume of the year thus far but still down 10 percent from a year ago, according to the TexAuto Facts report from InfoNation, a Sugar Land-based provider of automobile data.\n\n        Consumers have purchased 208,560 new vehicles this year, down 5 percent from the year-to-date period last year. Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n        “People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,” InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as 2018.”\n\n        On HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\n        The sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.\n\n        Industry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.\n\n        “The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\n        On HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\n        Despite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\n        The average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.\n\n        Houston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.\n\n        Nationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles will be sold this year.\n\n        paul.takahashi@chron.com\n\n        twitter.com/paultakahashi\n\n          More Business News\n\n          * Houston Housing Authority sued over alleged open meeting...\n\n          * New car sales plunge 10 percent in October\n\n          * Houston leads Texas in new home sales volume\n\n          * Report: Bank of America Tower sells for record per-foot price\n\n          * Oil falls most in 7 weeks amid supply rise, trade impasse\n\n          * Houston’s economy might not be as hot as it looks — and...\n\n          Most Popular\n\n              * 1\n\n                47 nabbed in massive Katy human-trafficking sting\n\n              * 2\n\n                Human trafficking, prostitution sting near The Woodlands nets 75\n\n              * 3\n\n                14-year-old girl missing from The Woodlands, last seen at mall\n\n              * 4\n\n                Cleveland ISD: White van being used to lure children\n\n              * 5\n\n                J.J.

It’s part of a larger pollution problem in India.\n      Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n        Another cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million residents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is likely to reach “severe” or “emergency” levels on Wednesday. The dangerous, dirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over India’s capital region.\n\n        It’s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as a “gas chamber.”\n\n          Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states\n\n          It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today\n\n          I urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\n\n          — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\n        The gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public health emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren.\n\n        Last week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of “hazardous.”\n\n        Air pollution in Delhi remains “unhealthy” this week.\n        Berkeley Earth\n\n        This surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it’s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 — particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems — were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\n        While the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians.\n\n        The dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.\n\n        Why Delhi’s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\n        Joshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, there’s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\n        In November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\n        Then there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi’s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region’s total pollution. Dust from the city’s construction boom is also a contributor to the city’s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\n        These sources contribute to Delhi’s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now.\n\n        As temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\n        Some of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.\n\n          The air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n\n          — Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\n        However, one of the largest sources of Delhi’s pollution right now isn’t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\n        Added together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. “It’s like you’re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that’s plugged up,” Apte said. “It overflows with spectacular consequences.”\n\n        Delhi’s air wasn’t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\n\n        “I’m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,” said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. “The [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?”\n\n        Prakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India’s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\n        Burning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality.\n        Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n        However, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act.\n\n        One of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\n        By most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab’s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\n        These farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can’t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting — burning crop stubble.\n\n        This satellite image from NASA’s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.\n        NASA Worldview\n\n        Of course, it’s not just rural pollution that’s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution — traffic, construction, cooking fires — have also increased as the region’s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\n        Together, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\n\n        Delhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\n\n        This year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\n        Brick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\n        India’s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\n\n        Added together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it’s because of shifts in the weather — not policy.\n\n        “This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi’s air to slightly improve,” Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.\n\n        Officials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.\n        Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n        Getting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. “Part of the challenge is that there’s a character of ‘Oh no, you first,’ ‘No, you first,’” Apte said. “No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.”\n\n        Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution — many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds.\n\n        Despite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India’s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n        “People will be up in revolt, they’ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,” Prakash said. “It’s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.”\n\n        Air pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\n        Many cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\n\n        In the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\n        But the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\n        This is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.\n\n        The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\n        Ecological Economics\n\n        But Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China’s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n        “The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,” Prakash said. “Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.”\n\n        That’s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\n        India also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.\n\n        Within Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. “If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,” Prakash said. It’s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.\n\n        Heavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\n        Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n        That means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n        It shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.\n\n        While some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. “The problem can be solved,” Prakash said. “But what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.”\n\n        Next Up In Science & Health\n\n          * A clever new solar solution to one of the trickiest climate problems\n          * How Apollo moon rocks reveal the epic history of the cosmos\n          * These senators are going after the biggest climate villains in Washington\n          * Brazil’s Amazon rainforest destruction is at its highest rate in more than a decade\n          * Trump’s controversial vaping flavor ban is now dead\n          * With impeachment, America’s epistemic crisis has arrived\n\n        Most Read\n\n           1.

For this years’ edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme ‘The Medium is the Message’. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition – in the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\n\n            Cover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\n            A selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\n            Ivana Jelić and Pavle Petrović (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\n            Groupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\n\n            Amigo & amigo (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\n            OGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\n\n            Balmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli, Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\n\n            Light as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\n            From hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme ‘The Medium is the Message‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\n            On behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\n            Some of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival – previews\n\n            Light a Wish by OGE Group\n\n            Parabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo\n\n            Portam Civitatis by Peter Snijder\n\n            Spider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS\n\n            7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n            29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019\n\n            sponsored links\n\n              More in Amsterdam\n\n              Amsterdam\n\n            sponsored links\n\n        Search Inexhibit\n\n\n\n        InDi Design Index\n\n        Specials\n\n            * The design of everyday technology\n\n            * Visionary computer design of the past\n\n            * Examples of digital communication technology in culture and education\n\n            * Venice Art Biennale 2017 | info, program, exhibitions, and events\n\n            * Wood Architecture & Design\n\n            * 58th Venice Biennale of Art 2019 | May You Live in Interesting Times\n\n            * Museums of archaeology and archaeological sites around the world\n\n            * 16th Venice Architecture Biennale 2018 – pavilions, program, events\n\n            * Venice Architecture Biennale 2016 – Reporting from the Front – INDEX\n\n            * Venice Art Biennale 2015 – All the World’s Futures – Index\n\n          recently-added locations\n\n              * Mantua and Cremona\n\n              * Naples and Campania\n\n              * Chicago\n\n              * San Francisco\n\n              * Washington, D.C.\n\n              * Turin\n\n              * Dallas – Fort Worth\n\n              * Innsbruck and Austrian Tyrol\n\n          Subscribe to Inexhibit’s newsletter\n\n    copyright Inexhibit 2019 - ISSN: 2283-5474\n\n    * About Inexhibit\n    * Copyright\n    * Contact Us\n    * Advertise\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookies\n    * Newsletter\n    * Cookie policy\n        * HOME\n        * Architecture\n        * Design\n        * Art\n        * Cities\n        * myMuseum\n        * Specials\n        * English\n            + Italian"

trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\n\n                    But it may morph into something bigger if US President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\n\n                    China's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has US officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\n                    Two people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\n                    \"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\n                    Scissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\n                    That would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n                    But Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\n\n                    Beijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\n\n                    One Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\n\n                    Trump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\n                    Trump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\n                    The president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\n                    A 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\n                DH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n                  GET IT\n                United States\n                China\n                trade war\n                Trade deal\n\n\n\n\n              Comments (+)\n\n\n                  Related stories\n\n                        India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n\n                        Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\n\n                        China cuts new benchmark rate to boost economy\n\n                        Khamenei says enemy 'repelled' in protest-hit Iran\n\n                        Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n                        Last campus protesters hold out as HK schools reopen...\n\n              DH Picks\n\n                  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr...\n\n                  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n\n                  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams...\n\n                  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n\n                  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes...\n\n              social feed\n\n                    What does your star sign say?\n\n                    Explore\n\n          National\n\n              * Politics\n              * North and Central\n              * South\n              * East and Northeast\n              * West\n\n          Karnataka\n\n              * Top Stories\n              * Politics\n              * Districts\n\n          Bengaluru\n\n              * Top Stories\n              * Bengaluru Crime\n              * Politics\n              * Infrastructure\n              * Life in the City\n\n          Sports\n\n              * Cricket\n              * ICC World Cup 2019\n              * Formula 1 with DH\n              * Football\n              * Tennis\n              * Sportscene\n              * Other Sports\n\n          Business\n\n              * Business News\n              * Budget 2019\n              * Economy & Business\n              * Family Finance\n              * Technology\n              * DH Wheels\n\n          Multimedia\n\n              * Videos\n              * Photos\n\n          Opinion\n\n              * DH Views\n              * Editorials\n              * Panorama\n              * Comment\n              * In Perspective\n              * Right in the Middle\n\n          Entertainment\n\n              * Entertainment News\n              * DH Talkies\n              * Arts, Books & Culture\n\n          Maharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\n          Karnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\n          India vs Bangladesh\n\n          Chandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\n          Ayodhya verdict\n\n          Pegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\n            DH Picks\n\n          * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep\n          * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n          * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n          * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n          * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\n            Latest stories\n\n          * India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n          * Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\n          * Blood-stained dress of Congress MLA in Kerala Assembly\n          * NCLAT rejects DBS Bank's plea\n          * Arrests ordered in Philippines vaping ban\n\n            Trending news\n\n          * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n          * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n          * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n          * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n          * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\n            Services\n\n          * About\n          * Epaper\n          * Newsletter\n          * Archives\n          * Sitemap\n          * Classifieds\n          * Contact\n\n            Our group sites\n\n          * Printers Mysore\n          * Prajavani\n          * Sudha\n          * Mayura\n          * Privacy Policy\n          * Terms\n          * Disclaimer\n        © 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n          * \n          * \n          * \n          * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n          * X Share via\n              + \n              + \n              + \n              + \n            Share permalink\n\n  We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

NASA’s commercial moon shot: Musk's and Bezos's firms to bid\n\n                                                NASA’s sights are set on landing on our Moon and Mars, but Jupiter’s moon Europa may have the ingredients for life.\n\n                                                      by Laura Winter\n                                                        19 Nov 2019 05:44 GMT\n\n                                                          This illustration of SpaceX's concept for a commercial lunar lander shows how private operators could possibly take people back to the Moon [SpaceX via Nasa]\n\n                                                            Washington, DC, United States : Getting to the Moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven’t. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\n                                                            It is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry’s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\n                                                            More:\n\n                                                              * The New Space Race\n\n                                                              * Spacewalking into 'her-story'\n\n                                                              * China completes landing test for its first Mars mission in 2020\n\n                                                            “We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\n                                                            “This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,” he said.\n\n                                                            A year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\n\n                                                            The importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted “technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays ”. The report and Monday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\n\n                                                            In May, NASA’s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter’s moon Europa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\n                                                            NASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\n\n                                                            Closer to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year’s original list.\n\n                                                            “We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting times. We’re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\n                                                            While payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\n\n                                                            Rounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n                                                            “Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n                                                            “There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.”\n\n                                                            SOURCE: Al Jazeera News\n\n                                                            ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n                                                                Laura Winter\n\n                                                                * Science & Technology\n                                                                * Space\n                                                                * United States\n                                                                * Business & Economy\n                                                                * US & Canada\n                                                                                            Have your say.Give us feedback.\n                                                                                            Sign up for ourNewsletter.\n                            * News\n                            * Programmes\n                            * Opinion\n                            * About\n                            * Investigations\n                            * Video\n                            * Privacy Policy\n                            * Cookie Policy\n                            * Cookie Preferences\n                            * Facebook\n                            * Twitter\n                            * RSS\n                            * Podcast\n                            * YouTube\n                            * SnapChat\n\n                          About\n\n                            * About Us\n                            * Code of Ethics\n                            * Terms and Conditions\n                            * Privacy Policy\n                            * Cookie Policy\n                            * Cookie Preferences\n                            * Community Guidelines\n                            * Work for us\n                            * HR Quality\n\n                          Connect\n\n                            * Contact Us\n                            * Apps\n                            * Social\n                            * Channel Finder\n                            * TV Schedule\n                            * Podcasts\n                            * Newsletter\n                            * Submit a Tip\n                            * Directory\n\n                          Our Channels\n\n                            * Al Jazeera Arabic\n                            * Al Jazeera English\n                            * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n                            * Al Jazeera Documentary\n                            * Al Jazeera Balkans\n                            * AJ+\n\n                          Our Network\n\n                            * Jetty\n                            * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n                            * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n                            * Learn Arabic\n                            * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n                            * Al Jazeera Forum\n                            * Al Jazeera Film Festival\n                            * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\n                        © 2019 Al Jazeera Media Network\n"

Video Shows Dramatic Rescue of Kidnapped Girl\n\n    A video showing the dramatic moment a kidnapped 8-year-old Fort Worth girl was rescued by police was released on Monday. (Published Monday, Nov. 18, 2019)\n\n    A video showing the dramatic moment a kidnapped 8-year-old Fort Worth girl was rescued by police was released Monday.\n\n    The suspect, Michael Webb, was convicted and sentenced to life in federal prison last Thursday.\n\n        * Help Shape the Future of Public Transit in Fort Worth\n\n    Now that his federal trial has ended, federal prosecutors in Texas released the body camera footage when officers found and rescued her from a Forest Hill hotel room and arrested Webb.\n\n    A family friend found the suspect's car in the hotel parking lot and called 911.\n\n        * Man Shot at Dallas Gas Station Dies at Hospital\n\n    The video shows officers racing up a staircase, converging outside the suspect's room and banging on the door.\n\n    \"Fort Worth P.D.

Video Shows Dramatic Rescue of Kidnapped Girl\n\n        A video showing the dramatic moment a kidnapped 8-year-old Fort Worth girl was rescued by police was released on Monday. NBC 5 has edited the video to exclude graphic content and protect the identity of the victim.\n\n      (Published Monday, Nov. 18, 2019)\n\n    The suspect said he needed to get dressed.\n\n    Police used a ram to force open the door.\n\n        * 3 Hospitalized After Wrong-Way Crash in North Richland Hills\n\n    \"Hands! Let me see your hands!\" an officer ordered. \"Step out.\"\n\n    Webb emerged, naked.\n\n        * Updated Police Identify Man, Woman Found Dead in Plano Apartment\n\n    And officers rushed in, frantically looking for the little girl.\n\n    At first, there was no sign of her.\n\n        * Fitzgerald Equates Firing to Professional 'Death Sentence'\n\n    But suddenly, they found her buried in a clothes basket where he forced her to hide while threatening to kill her parents.\n\n    \"Hey, here she is. Got her!\" an officer said. \"We got her. We got her.\"\n\n        * Fort Worth May Dry Human Waste and Sell It as Fertilizer\n\n    Officers arrested Webb in the hallway and carried the girl to safety in the parking lot where they called an ambulance.\n\n    \"Come on, sweetheart. You are going to be OK,\" an officer told the girl.\n\n        * New Safety Recommendations Issued After Deadly SWA Flight\n\n    Earlier that night, a Forest Hill police sergeant searched that same hotel room but did not find the girl. He was later fired.\n\n    Webb confessed to the crime and the jury took just 15 minutes to find him guilty.\n\n        * 9-Month-Old's Life Support Restraining Order Extended\n\n    Webb still faces nine state charges of aggravated kidnapping, six counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child (enhanced) and two counts of indecency with a child (habitual offender notice).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Leave Comments\n            * News\n            * Weather\n            * Investigations\n            * Entertainment\n            * Traffic\n            * Contact Us\n              Connect With Us\n            * KXAS Public Inspection File\n            * Employment\n            * Send Feedback\n            * Terms of service\n            * Privacy policy\n          © 2019 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.

Wait, what?\n\n                The drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which already held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops getting involved in the music industry.\n\n                Why? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become an incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks begin circling*\n\n                Back to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?\n\n                It’s complicated.\n\n                According to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka original recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the American Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\n                It's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to their original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an artist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in Swift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist financially.\n\n                He said, she said\n\n                T-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The Carlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ... because hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has denied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift fans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\n                The bottom line ...\n\n                Taylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be re-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the radio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to Big Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\n                Moving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music Group, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to deserve this?\"\n\n                Why Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n                    The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday highs earlier in the session.\n\n                    Traders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and China could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to drift and bond prices to go higher.\n\n                    U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of tariffs is due to start in mid-December.\n\n                    Oil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut its oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month.\n\n                    Separately, Norway’s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential oversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent prices lower.\n\n                    “Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\n                    U.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $60.73, down 2.74% on the day.\n\n                    On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or 0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66.\n\n                    Hopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year high and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two years, but those gains were pared later in the session.\n\n                    The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.12% while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight session of gains.\n\n                    Emerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan’s Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 0.66%.\n\n                    Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened.\n\n                    Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%, down from 1.808% late on Monday.\n\n                    The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from 2.293% late on Monday.\n\n                    The dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075.\n\n                    While the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered expectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.\n\n                    “Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus risk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact that the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed’s ability to satisfy anyone is in question,” Perez said.\n\n                    The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.\n\n                    Spot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.\n\n                    Copper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.\n\n                    Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,737.00 a tonne.\n\n                    (Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - here)\n\n                    (Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - here)\n\n                    (Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - here)\n\n                        Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler\n\n                      Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n      0 : 0\n        * narrow-browser-and-phone\n        * medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\n        * landscape-tablet\n        * medium-wide-browser\n        * wide-browser-and-larger\n        * medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\n        * medium-wide-browser-and-larger\n        * above-phone\n        * portrait-tablet-and-above\n        * above-portrait-tablet\n        * landscape-tablet-and-above\n        * landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\n        * portrait-tablet-and-below\n        * landscape-tablet-and-below\n              * Apps\n              * Newsletters\n              * Advertise with Us\n              * Advertising Guidelines\n              * Cookies\n              * Terms of Use\n              * Privacy\n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n\n              All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\n\n          It’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\n\n          Where it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\n          Fallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\n\n          One of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn’t matter to the general story.\n\n          After hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez’s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character.\n\n          I have to give special attention to his voice direction – and my god, every little animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s BT-7274.\n\n          The general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn’t so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\n          You control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\n          This means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want to.\n\n          I visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\n          As more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at any point – such a lifesaver.\n\n          The map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\n\n          In your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however – units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\n          Those not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\n\n\n            The best new character in 2019.\n\n          Fallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\n          You’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\n          I understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\n          A better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\n          Fallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\n          You and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you’ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution.\n\n          Enemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\n          Another problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry.\n\n          Fallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated and you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t working.\n\n          Over time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack.\n\n          These little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me.\n\n          Which brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually – but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win.\n\n          The action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\n\n          And yes, it doesn’t always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent – albeit flawed – combat.\n\n          Version tested: PC.\n\n            Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Glass was 20-of-24 passing for 235 yards.\n\n        The Eagles led 14-7 at halftime before scoring 24 points in the third quarter for a 38-10 bulge.\n\n        Huskies quarterback Marcus Childers was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Tre Harbison rushed for 112 yards on 30 carries for NIU.\n\n        The three previous games between these programs went to overtime.\n\n        Extra points\n\n        The status of quarterback Tanner Morgan is uncertain for Minnesota’s game at Northwestern after back-to-back sacks in the last game put the sophomore in the concussion protocol.\n\n        Coach P.J. Fleck said Morgan has made progress this week, but the Big Ten’s leading passer has not been cleared. The Gophers (9-1, 6-1) play Saturday against the Wildcats (2-8, 0-7), with a one-game lead in the West Division on Wisconsin.\n\n        Morgan could be a game-time decision. If he doesn’t play, either Jacob Clark or Cole Kramer would start. They’re both true freshmen that Fleck would prefer to keep at the four-game limit to preserve their redshirt status.\n\n        ... Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford said he received death threats on social media after the Nittany Lions’ Nov. 9 loss at Minnesota.\n\n        ... Vanderbilt athletic director Malcolm Turner said Derek Mason has his full support as the Commodores coach and they’ll be working together to give the football program the resources and support needed to succeed.\n\n          Published 11:11 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\n\n    Terms of Service Privacy Notice\n    © The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper"

(Photo Credit : PTI File Photo )\n\n              In case you are living in Delhi-NCR, chances are you have an app or two to find out the latest air quality index in your area. Since Diwali, despite the Supreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the monitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become a standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower surface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the National Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social media about an ‘oxygen bar’!\n\n              Yup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Condé Nast Traveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about this unique ‘bar’. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone who is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we have an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\n              The answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and landed up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi’s Saket area that offers this unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is ‘Oxy Pure’. “An Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched with an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air pollutants in a cost-effective manner,” the description on the website reads.\n\n              Offering ‘rejuvenating’ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, “consists of an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating customers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula along with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you with more vigour and energy.”\n\n              The brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and Margarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas and decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299 for fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\n              So now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to visit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right now is 218, which is in ‘poor’ category.\n\n            First Published: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 08:38 AM\n            * \n            * \n            * \n            * \n            * \n\n            Related Tags:\n\n              * Delhi Pollution\n              * Delhi Smog\n              * Oxygen\n              * Saket\n              * Air Quality\n\n\n              Post Comment (+)\n          LIVE TV VIdeos Photos\n\n          Photo Gallery\n\n                * Happy Birthday Rajkumar Hirani: 5 Movies Of The Director That You Can Watch On Loop\n\n                * International Men’s Day: Most Handsome Classic Actors That Even Put John Legend To Shame\n\n              * \n\n                * Happy Birthday Sushmita Sen: These Pictures Of Former Miss Universe With Rohman Shawl Are Just Unmissable!\n\n                * Farhan Akhtar's Girlfriend Shibani Dandekar Sets Internet On Fire With Super-Sexy Pictures\n\n      * Terms of Use\n      * Career\n      * Advertise With Us\n      * Complaint Redressal\n      * Contact Us\n      * Feedback\n      * Sitemap\n      * RSS\n      © 2019 News Nation.

Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's third child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10, during which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\n            Andrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get pizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\n            Andrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with Giuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he had a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.\n\n            “Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”\n\n            But, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he explained that he can sweat now.\n\n            Andrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if there was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they were friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply can’t remember.\n\n            “There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if there was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’ campaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about getting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to look for but I never saw them.”\n\n            The fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t seem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\n            As if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the accusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with Epstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In other words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can teach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\n            The interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in associating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n            \"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre said before the interview. \"And I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\n            Andrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent denials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from politicians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their connections with him.\n\n            Unfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his publicist quitting. After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more careful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what appears to be guilt.\n\n          Opinion\n          Beltway Confidential\n          Royals\n          Jeffrey Epstein\n          Sexual Assault\n          Media\n              * \n              * \n        Share your thoughts with friends.\n      * \n\n              * More Washington Examiner\n\n                      + Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\n                            Anthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n                            Wednesday November 20, 2019\n                          Our family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week.

But Volker sought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday, making himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n                      + Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\n                            Jenna Ellis\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          People are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment “scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly closed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his job. Here is what we learned:\n\n                      + Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\n                            Tom Rogan\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Beyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-Ukraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to Ukraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr Zelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n                      + First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\n                            Tom Rogan\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          The first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be held on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n                      + Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\n                            Tiana Lowe\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          The core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did President Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign government to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats attempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the pivot bombed fantastically.\n\n                      + It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\n                            Kaylee McGhee\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on Tuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not leak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n                      + Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\n                            Kimberly Ross\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Monday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no longer donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community left some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the militant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, continue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the announcement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold Christian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\" will not be satisfied.\n\n                      + 'Just not accurate': GOP congressman rips New York Times over Vindman tweet\n\n                            Dominick Mastrangelo\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Rep.

Afterwards, The Tennis Podcast team of Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts gave their initial impressions of the new format.\n\n              Is it fair to say that the event was neither as bad as the sceptics thought it would be, nor as good as the organisers hoped it would be? Was it a misjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some Belgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled differently to make sure it is always live? And in what way was an authentic Davis Cup atmosphere created by fans on the smaller stadiums?\n\n              M uch of the focus on day one was about the feel and staging of the event, rather than forehands and backhands, but there’s also discussion about Russia’s straightforward victory against defending champions Croatia, Colombia’s valiant effort against Belgium, and Canada’s exciting win over Italy.\n\n              The Tennis Podcast is produced weekly throughout the year, daily during the Grand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP Finals, and the Fed Cup and Davis Cup Finals.\n\n                * This week's Tennis Podcast is sponsored by the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals, which takes place 18-24 November.

Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is stocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel Studios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”\n\n                  There were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had forgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being abruptly logged off the service.\n\n                  “We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make me feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  Disney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week.\n\n                        Kevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming service\n                        (Walt Disney Co.)\n\n                  An undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial, although it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n                  “We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer said.\n\n                  The streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  While traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game.\n\n                  Netflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n                  “We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will succeed.”\n\n                  Wall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\n                  He declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\n                  Eventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n                  “There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said. “We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.”\n\n                  Getting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a potential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the design and last week’s rollout of the service.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  Mayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international division in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and corporate strategy executive at the company.\n\n                  He led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and BamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological backbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.\n\n                  It’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-on operational role.\n\n                  “Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what I’m doing.”\n\n            Company TownTelevisionBusinessEntertainment & Arts\n              Newsletter\n            Get our daily Entertainment newsletter\n            Subscribe\n                  Meg James\n                      Follow Us\n                      * twitter\n                      * instagram\n                      * email\n                      * facebook\n                    Meg James is a corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, covering the business of television and digital disruption in the entertainment industry.

Skimming device found at Eagan Kwik Trip\n\n          BUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he always finds a way to start scoring.\n\n          “It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a little bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over the Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.”\n\n          Right now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is brimming with confidence.\n\n          Parise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56 – gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\n          For good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third period.\n\n          “That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing things for the team.”\n\n          Barely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks, could see the frustration on his friend’s face.\n\n          “He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said.\n\n          But Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games.\n\n          “You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.”\n\n          Parise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one.\n\n          He tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n          “He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need those goals.”\n\n          The Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n          “It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.”\n\n          Boudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in yourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.”\n\n          “You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told them. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n          “I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.”\n\n          The Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n          “I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and, like, I just wasn’t ready for it.”\n\n          Parise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.”\n\n          Eichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.”\n\n          Meanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period.\n\n          Defenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker’s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\n          The Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury.\n\n          “I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said.\n\n          * Tags:\n          * Minnesota Wild\n\n            Bill Hoppe\n\n      As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Follow us at Twitter @igndeals.We bring you the best deals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of random stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is approaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black Friday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\n            PS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\n            The price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\n              * Get it on Amazon for 39.99\n\n            Nintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\n            Save $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even on Black Friday).\n              * Get it at Walmart for $238.99\n\n            King of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R Curved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\n            This is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming monitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely love it, both for work and for games.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $649.99\n\n            New Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99 (Originally $200)\n\n            Score the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most people probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $169.99\n              * Also at Walmart\n\n            New Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\n\n            It's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped today to the lowest price we've ever seen.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $139\n              * Also at Walmart\n\n            45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\n            One of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift card, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're essentially getting it for $499.\n              * Get it at Dell for $549\n\n            Dell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD for $799.99\n\n            Use code \"50OFF699\"\n\n            This is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\n              * Use code \"50OFF699\" to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\n            Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\n            Clip the $10 off coupon on the product page\n\n            The Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $67.77\n\n            Get Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\n            This sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\n\n            If you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to uncover your login info one day—and if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\n              * Download Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n            4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\n            This deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don't have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\n              * Get 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n            $10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\n            Save a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\n              * Get it at Walmart for $249.95\n\n            New Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with Bonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\n            After a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\n              * Get it with Free Case at Walmart for $199.96\n              * Get it by itself on Amazon for $199\n\n            New Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon Credit\n\n            \"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review.\n\n            If you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but we confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it will end very, very soon so hurry!\n              * Get Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\n              * Get Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n\n            70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\n\n            I think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday season. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\n              * Get it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n            $15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\n            The new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $234.98\n\n            30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City 2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\n\n            The 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.\n              * Get it on Amazon for $243.97\n\n            Disney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package and Save $5/Month\n\n            Disney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription. This is also currently the only way to watch the new big Star Wars TV series, The Mandalorian, which airs starting today.\n\n            If you just want Disney+, you can sign up for a free 7-day trial. Afterwards you'll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you're in it for the long haul, then you can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.\n\n            An even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle. In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee services separately, you'd be paying around $17.99 per month, so you'd be saving $60 every year.\n\n            Note: The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-free Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle plan. Here's the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the Disney+ bundled package:\n              * Sign up for a Hulu ad-free account for $11.99 a month\n              * If you already have a Hulu account, visit your account page to upgrade\n              * Sign up for the Disney+ bundle using the same email as your Hulu account\n\n            ______________________________\n\n            Eric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts.\n              If you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\n\n        Apple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\n        While that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\n        Benioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"—and someone he's learned a lot from.\n\n        Hosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\n        To that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs.\n\n        But Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company.\n\n        Now his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices.\n\n        Benioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n        \"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don’t even own a computer anymore and I don’t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\"\n\n        Salesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\n        Cook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n        \"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff.\n\n        And they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\n        Cook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n        \"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\n        Jobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader.\n\n        \"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\n        Among those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said.\n\n        Apple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\n        Those values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented.\n\n        Cook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\"\n\n        Privacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\n      Related Topics:\n      * Smart Phones\n      * Cloud Software\n      * Enterprise Applications\n      Back to Top\n\n      related stories\n\n        * News Cloud\n\n          Drybar’s Rise To Success With NetSuite Has A Hidden Message For Partners\n\n        * News Cloud\n\n          ‘Unmistakable Bias’: AWS Challenges Microsoft’s JEDI Cloud Win\n\n        * News Cloud\n\n          10 Emerging Cloud Computing Trends To Watch In 2020\n\n        * News Cloud\n\n          5 Key Announcements At Microsoft Ignite 2019\n\n        * News Cloud\n\n          Rackspace Acquires Cloud-Native AWS Specialist Onica\n\n      trending stories\n\n       1.

Kong, pricing its shares at a 2.8 per cent discount to their New York close.\n\n          The Chinese e-commerce giant is set to officially announce the terms of the deal later on Wednesday, but investors have been told 176 Hong Kong dollars (£17.43) is likely to be the final numbers, Reuters reported.\n\n          Read more: Alibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\n          The deal – set to be the largest share sale in Hong Kong for nine years and a world record cross-border secondary share sale – represents a much-needed boost for the city’s bourse, which has been hit by months of anti-government protests.\n\n\n          At the reported pricing, Alibaba’s secondary listing would raise at least 88 billion Hong Kong dollars – a symbolic total as the number eight is associated with prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture.\n\n          The deal could eventually raise up to $12.9bn if a “green shoe” option is exercised, allowing underwriters to buy up to an additional 15 per cent of shares at the offering price.\n\n          An Alibaba spokesperson declined to comment on the pricing to Reuters.\n\n          Alibaba shares closed in New York on Tuesday at $185.25, up 0.35%. One of Alibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\n\n          The Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.\n\n          It is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company’s unusual governance structure.\n\n          Small investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.\n\n\n          Read more: Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weigh\n\n          Hong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\n\n          Alibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.\n\n          Main image credit: Getty\n\n          Share\n          * \n          * \n          * \n          * \n          * \n          * \n\n\n        Tags: Alibaba\n\n\n\n                  Related articles\n\n                        Alibaba’s secondary Hong Kong listing gets exchange approval\n\n                            Anna Menin\n\n                        Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba eyes $15bn Hong Kong listing in boost for troubled city\n\n                            James Booth\n\n                        Alibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\n                            Anna Menin\n            * Business\n            * Industries\n            * Markets\n            * Technology\n            * Leadership\n            * Life & Style\n            * Money\n            * Sport\n          Follow us for breaking news and latest updates:\n            * \n            * \n            * \n                * Stay up to date:\n                  Sign up to our daily newsletters\n                * Email\n                * Newsletters\n                      + Five at 5\n                      + Midday Update\n          * About\n          * Advertising\n          * Privacy\n          * Terms & Conditions\n          * Latest Edition\n        Copyright © 2019 CityAM.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\n                      The mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\n\n                      The order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\n                      It comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\n                      Emirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\n                      As of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\n\n                      Emirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\n                        Related Tags\n                        * Transportation\n                        * Travel\n                        * Emerging markets\n                        * Trade\n                        * Airbus Group SE\n                            Related\n                             1.

The protests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation that would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland. Although the bill was withdrawn, the protests had broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.\n\n            Related articles\n\n              * Hong Kong uprising: Protestors send defiant warning to China\n              * Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\n            Many of the protesters wear masks to shield their identities for protection.\n\n            China’s ambassador to Britain accused the UK and the US of meddling in the country’s affairs and warned that the Chinese government “will not sit on our hands” if the Hong Kong situation “becomes uncontrollable”.\n\n            Cheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, said: “These rioters, they are also criminals.

They are there to show sovereignty and are responsible for defence purposes.\n\n            SEE MORE: Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\n            Protesters do not want Hong Kong to lose its autonomy (Image: getty )\n\n            “If the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government certainly would not sit on our hands and watch.

Science & Astronomy\n\n  The Weird Plumes of Jupiter's Moon Europa Are Spewing Water Vapor\n\n    By Mike Wall 2019-11-18T20:51:19Z Science & Astronomy\n\n    Europa's plumes appear to be real, but very sporadic.\n\n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      Shares\n      An artist's illustration of a plume of water vapor emanating from Jupiter's moon Europa.\n      (Image: © NASA/ESA/K. Retherford/SWRI)\n\n    The Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.\n\n    NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n    \"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n    \"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\n    Related: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images\n\n    Paganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life.\n\n    The researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights — April 26, 2016 — they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\n\n    And there was quite a bit of the stuff — about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).\n\n    The researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n    Multiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\n    And it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n    \"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\n    Plumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.\n\n    NASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years — or if they just get really lucky.\n\n      * NASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life\n      * Photos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter\n      * Keck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea\n\n    Mike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), is out now.

It’s very simple.’” The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\n              Mr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\n              But more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe.\n\n              Despite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.\n\n              “We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. “I like\n\n              A prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\n              But businesses are not entertained.\n\n              Executives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by\n\n              The uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n              “It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. “The uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we’re experiencing today.”\n\n              MrEurope, Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.\n\n              The president says his approach has created leverage — and in some cases, he is right.\n\n              But that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more,\n\n              Eswar Prasad\n\n              The two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States “farm country,” but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\n              Without a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi,\n\n              Mr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.\n\n              But they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.\n\n              The roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect — or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\n\n              “It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said ”\n\n              Ev\n\n              In a letter to the president in May,\n\n              But Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger purchases “than any time in our history, by far” — into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\n              While China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries’, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\n              Even if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\n              Mr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached.\n\n              The president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator.\n\n              “Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?”\n\n              Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\n                Advertisement\n\n

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009’s Star Trek and 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film.\n\n          \"This will be Hawley’s second film\"\n\n        The fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pine’s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actors’ schedules shift. It’s unclear whether Hawley’s film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return — both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Wrap’s report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn’t mention Hemsworth.\n\n        There are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so it’s possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things weren’t murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\n        The fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawley’s second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics — and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n        No release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced.\n\n        Next Up In Tech\n\n        Good Deals\n\n           1.

World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli Settlements Illegal\n\n            World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli Settlements Illegal\n\n                Published November 20th, 2019 - 07:29 GMT\n                    A man rides on a donkey in the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares opposite the Israeli Jewish settlement of Revava (background) on November 19, 2019. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer considers settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but the Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\n                    Highlights\n                      Israeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\n                  The United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.\n\n                  The United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n                  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement.\n\n                  Pompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\n                  The decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\n                  Israeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\n                  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\n                  The EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\n                  Netanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n                  \"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\n                  The administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\n                  More than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\n                  Israel seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\n                  Settlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n                  The announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\n                  Analysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel.\n\n                  The Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\n                  The Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body.\n\n                  The only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\n                  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n                  \"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added.\n\n                  Key Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees.\n\n                  Russia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\n\n                  The French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\".\n\n                  A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\n                  The US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\n                  The European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\n                  The ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\n                  Israeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n                  \"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\n                  Erekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n                  \"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will stand tall.\"\n\n                  This article has been adapted from its original source.\n\n                Via SyndiGate.info\n\n\n                Copyright @ 2019 The New Arab.\n\n                You may also like\n\n                    View the discussion thread.\n\n                You may also like\n\n                    Subscribe\n\n                      Sign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n                      Subscribe Now\n\n                    * Latest\n                    * Popular\n\n                                    US: Top 100 Brands Are Worth More Than the GDP of Germany\n\n                                    Dubai’s Non-Oil Trade with Africa to Exceed $272 Billion\n\n                                    Next Khashoggi?

Here’s what he had to say…\n\n    Q: Junior – We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\n\n    A: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\n\n    Q: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\n\n    A: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\n\n    Q: How do you prioritize your day?\n\n    A: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things first”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.\n\n    The best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either. Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry. Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.\n\n    Q: What’s on the horizon for the business?\n\n    A: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\n\n    Q: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\n\n    A: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but the need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees, clients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct approach.\n\n    Q: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you’ve been named a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What’s it like to be named a 40 Under 40?\n\n    A: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It’s a very prestigious group of folks this year – and in years past – and I am so appreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I work with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I share this recognition with the entire Experience team.\n\n    Ok, now for a little fun.\n\n    Q: Where did you grow up?\n\n    A: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands – the most beautiful 87 square miles in the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\n\n    Q: Favorite childhood memory?\n\n    A: Trip to Disney World\n\n    Q: Favorite apps?\n\n    A: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile\n\n    Q: Favorite artists or groups?\n\n    A: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\n\n    Q: Favorite books?\n\n    A: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\n\n    Q: Favorite live event you’ve ever attended?\n\n    A: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record breaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely rocking!\n\n    Q: Favorite athlete?\n\n    A: Lebron James\n\n    Q: Favorite places you have visited?\n\n    A: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\n\n    Q: Most memorable live event experience?\n\n    A: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50 plus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma City Thunder – AND, seeing Adele live in concert – she brought the house down!\n\n    Q: What are your hobbies?\n\n    A: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my family.\n\n    Q: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years\n\n    A: Sonos – Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your house with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it in an incredibly simple way.\n\n    Thanks Junior!\n\n      « Previous Post Next Post »\n        * Categories:\n            + Fan Testimonial\n            + How To\n            + Opinions\n            + Partner Announcement\n            + Partner Success\n            + Press\n            + Pro Tips\n            + Research\n            + Solutions\n            + Spotlight\n            + Updates\n\n    Other pages\n\n        Experience\n\n          * Who We Are\n          * Our Team\n          * Work With Us\n          * Press/Media Center\n          * Privacy\n          * Terms\n\n        Solutions\n\n          * Mobile Commerce\n          * Ticketing Technology\n          * Data Solutions\n\n        Community\n\n          * Blog\n          * Engineering Blog\n          * Twitter\n          * LinkedIn\n          * Facebook\n          * Instagram\n\n        Our mobile commerce, flexible ticket sales, and data solutions empower sports and entertainment leaders to generate new revenue streams, sell more tickets, and make smarter decisions.\n\n        Contact us\n        3535 Piedmont Rd NE #415 Atlanta, GA 30305\n          © 2019 Experience"

The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is Google's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\n\n  Stadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\n  Lewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\n  \"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google’s planned 'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community...and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\n\n  For established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\n  \"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the opportunity and we’ll see how it goes.\"\n\n  Google is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\n\n  For the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\n  \"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you’re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\n  \"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\n\n  While Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we'd look at.\"\n\n  While aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\n\n  \"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward.\n\n  Buser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet. It’s tough to go back to console.\"\n\n    * FACEBOOK\n    * TWITTER\n    * EMAIL ME\n\n      * Patrick Shanley\n\n        patrick.shanley@THR.com @pshanley88\n      The Hollywood Reporter\n\n    © 2019 The Hollywood Reporter\n    All rights reserved.\n\n    The Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.\n\n    Terms of Use | Privacy | Sitemap | About Our Ads\n\n      * About Us\n      * Daily Edition\n      * Subscribe\n      * Subscriber Services\n      * Back Issues\n      * Advertising\n      * Contact Us\n      * Tipline\n      * Careers\n      * Industry Jobs\n      * Follow Us On Twitter\n      * Find Us On Facebook\n      * Watch Us On Youtube\n\n      Our affiliate publications\n\n        * Billboard\n        * Vibe\n        * Spin\n        * Stereogum\nCookie Settings"

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.\n\n                      Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole.\n                        News industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\n                  But there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  Advertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don’t much care for.\n\n                  “Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s produced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\n                  The merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it “immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\n                          Column: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in newspapers — for plundering\n                            Column: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in newspapers — for plundering\n                          Among those who believe that the press provides value for society — especially local journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians’ hands out of the public cookie jar — Alden Global Capital is a “vulture investing” firm that makes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  The private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources — with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n                  (Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)\n\n                  But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t escape the industry’s economic challenges.\n\n                  Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company’s news assets.\n\n                  But the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\n                  McClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\n\n                          Business\n                          Tribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n                            Business\n                            Tribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n                          The owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board, but it’s still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some shareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\n\n                  That said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro newspapers.\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  Tribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\n                  Indeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune. Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\n                  The most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the news audience has been moving to.\n\n                  GateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and page design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy reported.\n\n                  Reed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It shouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\n\n                          Business\n                          Column: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n                            Business\n                            Column: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n                          Freelance writers and photographers fear California’s new gig worker law will make them unemployable.\n\n                  The increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\n                  Fortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n\n                        Advertisement\n\n                  “I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t even take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)\n\n                  Plunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,” says Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”\n\n                  In the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\n                  As traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace — those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.\n\n                  “After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription? What’s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?”\n\n            Business\n              Newsletter\n            Get our weekly California Inc. newsletter\n            Subscribe\n                  Michael Hiltzik\n                      Follow Us\n                      * twitter\n                      * instagram\n                      * email\n                      * facebook\n                    Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael Hiltzik writes a daily blog appearing on latimes.com.

Advice\n\n    Dear Abby: Husband springs for business class flight to India, but leaves wife in economy seat\n\n      Today 12:01 AM\n\n        By Abigail Van Buren\n\n        DEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to India. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\n\n        Am I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\n        DEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\n        DEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\n        My husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\n\n        The restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\n        DEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\n\n        DEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\n\n        A few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\n\n        DEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\n\n        Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Some bugs are noticeable at once at testing, and some can be notice only at the certain combination of actions. Most of bugs found by you during the game. And, thanks to your reports about them, I can quickly fix it.\n\n            So, if you notice that some game mechanics are working incorrectly, or some event used to work before, and now you cannot start it, or even you just cannot press some button, spend a minute of time and write about it in the bug-tracker. In such way you can help make my games better.\n\n              * Facebook\n              * Twitter\n              * Email\n              * Pinterest\n              * LinkedIn\n              * Odnoklassniki\n              * WhatsApp\n              * VKontakte\n              * Telegram\n              * Facebook\n              * Twitter\n              * Email\n              * Pinterest\n              * LinkedIn\n              * Odnoklassniki\n              * WhatsApp\n              * VKontakte\n              * Telegram\n              Previous Post\n              Next Post\n\n              Leave a Reply\n\n              You must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n          Close\n\n                Author’s column\n\n                  * Upcoming Hero’s Base updates\n                      Sometimes people ask me why this or that location become […]\n                  * Last Man: Skills system update\n                      I want to tell you about another important change in Last Man, […]\n                  * Bonuses of May\n                      I haven’t written anything for a long time in the author’s […]\n                  * 100% Walkthrough\n                      This is a hidden post for club members.

Kristi NoemKristi Lynn NoemSouth Dakota governor doubles down on 'meth, we're on it' anti-drug campaign South Dakota drops pipeline protest laws after lawsuit New South Dakota law requiring 'In God We Trust' sign to hang in public schools goes into effect MORE (R) is defending the state’s launch of an anti-drug campaign with the slogan “Meth, we’re on it.”\n\n                    The tagline drew a mix of criticism and ridicule across Twitter on Monday, but Noem cited the backlash as proof that efforts to raise awareness around South Dakota's methamphetamine crisis was, in fact, working.\n\n                    “Meth is IN SD. Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it - Meth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,” Noem tweeted Monday night.\n\n                        ADVERTISEMENT\n\n                    Noem later tweeted that the state’s meth epidemic “needs to be a dinner table conversation,” adding “we need everyone on it.”\n\n                    The campaign, which includes both digital and TV ads, cost the state roughly $449,000, according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n\n                    One campaign video featured a series of South Dakotans — including both adults and children — declaring, “I’m on meth.” The video, as well as photos of people with the tagline, prompted some Twitter users to argue that the promotional material made it look as if those featured in the campaign were on the drug themselves.\n\n                    “South Dakota: if we were any higher, we’d be North Dakota,” one user quipped.\n\n                    Another wondered why the state bothered to trademark the tagline in the first place.\n\n                    I love that they trademarked it. Don't worry, South Dakota, no one's going to take your slogan. https://t.co/XPxUJuyIAC\n\n                    — Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) November 18, 2019\n\n                    The latest initiative comes as the state struggles to address its growing rate of methamphetamine use in recent years, particularly among its youth.\n\n                    In 2016, the South Dakota's Department of Social Services reported that the number of young people in the state who have reported using meth was 3.8 percent, compared to the national average of 3 percent.\n\n                    The National Institute on Drug Abuse has also estimated that 964,000 people age 12 and older, which account for about 0.4 percent of the total U.S. population, reported a methamphetamine use disorder in 2017, marking a significant increase from the previous year.\n\n                    The governor's office didn't immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\n                Tags Kristi Noem South Dakota\n\n                View the discussion thread.\n\n          Most Popular\n\n          Video\n\n                  Krystal Ball issues warning to Biden supporters\n                    Rising\n                  Most GOP voters say adoption agencies shouldn't be allowed to refuse same-sex couples\n                    Rising\n                  Sanders official predicts health care, climate change will be top issues in fifth Democratic debate\n                    Rising\n                  Bernie surrogate: Moderate candidates more frightened by Sanders than Trump\n                    Rising\n\n          More From The Web\n\n            Don't miss a brief.

The Dark Enchantment of Carmen Maria Machado’s Memoir, In the Dream House\n\n      Three years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford’s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.\n\n      The Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.\n\n      I wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It’s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford’s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn’t anyone publishing his books?\n\n      It would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford’s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn’t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?\n\n      John Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, “He was brilliant from the start—reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.” He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly—after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*\n\n      After that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. “When you’re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,” said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. “Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.”\n\n      All his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he’s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. “You’re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that’s out of the water in every novel,” she said. “It makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it’s too hard for people because he wouldn’t spell things out.” When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he’d respond, “I have a horror of being obvious.”\n\n      Ford also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what’s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford’s characters often do. If there’s one unifying theme to his books, it’s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.\n\n        “Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” — Neil Gaiman\n\n      But the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called “Ask Dr. Mike” at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World, the first book in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called “Winter Solstice, Camelot Station,” went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here.)\n\n      “He would make art in the most surprising places,” Gaiman told me. “Once he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.” When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. “Life was not long enough,” she recalled, “for Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.”\n\n      “He could have had a more successful career,” Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa’s husband and Tor’s editor in chief, said, “if he had been more disciplined about his writing” and stuck to one genre, or written a series. “But Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.”\n\n      No single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, “Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels (The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet?, both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night “should’ve been marketed like The Name of the Rose. You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.’ ” Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin’s, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn’t exactly do Umberto Eco–level business.\n\n        Neil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002.\n        Photo by David Dyer-Bennet\n\n      Even if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. “All it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,” Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. “To be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn’t.”\n\n      To the extent that Ford’s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor’s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a “games consultant” for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his “blood brother,” had essentially adopted him.\n\n      Ford needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford’s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford’s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford’s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\n\n      The two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. “My partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,” Matthesen recalled in an email. “I used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.”\n\n      “The thing with Elise bothered” Ford’s family, Starner said. “I don’t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.” But either way, at some point, Ford’s now-deceased father told Starner that “the only way I know he’s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.”\n\n      In his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as “a magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.” When he’d finish chunks of it, he’d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.\n\n      Although Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. “It’s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,” he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:\n\n        If a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.\n\n        If he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\n\n        If he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.\n\n      Two months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. “He looked a little surprised,” she wrote in an email. “Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.” Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had “married,” but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (“The Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,” was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford’s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford’s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford’s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.\n\n      According to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford’s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford’s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford’s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford’s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford’s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\n\n      By 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion, and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished Aspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford’s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford’s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford’s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.\n\n      An agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford’s sister, Martha Fry. “I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,” she said.\n\n        All contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\n\n      Martha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was “introverted by nature.” “I once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,” Dale wrote. “We went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. … Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.” Martha added that shortly before their father’s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was “kind and loving.”\n\n      They also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike’s relationship with Elise. “Mike’s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,” Dale wrote. “I am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike’s body and calling the police. … Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as ‘friend,’ not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.”\n\n      They refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with “the unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals … if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike’s commercial affairs.” However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike’s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn’t hear back, they assumed there wasn’t.\n\n      This seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford’s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family’s requests?\n\n      The answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford’s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford’s death, his agent Valerie Smith “was beginning the process of essentially vanishing” from the industry. She “became more and more intermittent” with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.\n\n      After a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone. Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford’s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978. Web of Angels was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her “pretty overwhelmed,” she said. Her heartbreak over Mike Ford’s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. “When I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,” she said. “I just can’t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.” Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford’s work.\n\n      And so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford’s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family’s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\n\n      But I reconnected Ford’s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish—at long last—the unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\n\n      As in one of John M. Ford’s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It’s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It’s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they’ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\n\n      When I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford’s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\n      “I don’t even have words, it’s such good news,” she replied in an email. “Except maybe Mike’s words.”\n\n      In 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I’m going to die. Tell me a story.\n\n      “No,” he said. “No. You tell me one, and when you’re gone, I’ll tell it to somebody else.”\n\n        Correction, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M. Ford’s novel Web of Angels. It was Pocket, not Tor.\n\n        * Tweet\n        * Share\n        * Comment\n      Books Fantasy Science Fiction Slate Book Review\n    * Reprints\n    * Advertise: Site / Podcasts\n    * Commenting\n    * Podcast FAQs\n    * Contact / Feedback\n    * Pitch guidelines\n    * Corrections\n    * About us\n    * Work with us\n    * Send us tips\n    * User agreement\n    * Privacy policy\n    * AdChoices\n    * Slate Shop\n      Follow Us\n    Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Feed\n\n    Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n    All contents © 2019 The Slate Group LLC.

Does Marie Yovanovitch Have a Net Worth of $17 Million?\n\n        Does Marie Yovanovitch Have a Net Worth of $17 Million?\n\n        An unsubstantiated rumor was circulated in November 2019 in an apparent attempt to discredit the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n            * Dan Evon\n            * Published 18 November 2019\n\n          Image via Getty Images\n\n        Claim\n\n          Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million.\n\n        Rating\n\n              Unproven\n\n              About this rating\n\n              Do you rely on Snopes reporting?

Shortly after, some of Trump’s defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador’s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\n\n          We have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n\n          Those making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence. Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune.\n\n          In other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\n\n          While the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\n\n          One possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates.\n\n          Some social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates.\n\n          The articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure.\n\n          We reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\n\n          In sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony.\n\n                        Snopes.com\n                        Since 1994\n\n                        A Word to Our Loyal Readers\n\n                        Support Snopes and make a difference for readers everywhere.\n\n                      Read the Letter\n\n                                Editorial\n\n                                  * David Mikkelson\n                                  * Doreen Marchionni\n                                  * David Emery\n                                  * Bond Huberman\n                                  * Jordan Liles\n                                  * Alex Kasprak\n                                  * Dan Evon\n                                  * Dan MacGuill\n                                  * Bethania Palma\n                                  * Liz Donaldson\n\n                                Operations\n\n                                  * Vinny Green\n                                  * Ryan Miller\n                                  * Chris Reilly\n                                  * Chad Ort\n                                  * Elyssa Young\n\n                              Most Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?” Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of political, scientific, legal, historical, and visual information.

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\n            Why is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n            \"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.\n\n                Close\n\n            Experts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.\n\n                  related news\n\n                  * FIIs bullish on India, growth should start accelerating in Q2CY20, says Ridham Desai\n\n                  * Taking Stock: Historic day on D-St! Here's what is driving the rally\n\n            \"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\n            A key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\n            The September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\n            Tax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\n\n            \"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\n\n            For the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\n            Bank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\n\n            \"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.\n\n            Global financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\n\n            Near-term consolidation likely\n\n            Hungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"\n\n            The hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n            \"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\n            An extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\n            Coming back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\n            Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\n\n            \"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\n            The valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\n            The Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n            \"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.\n\n            Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Working with these players is what has attracted me.\"\n\n    Tottenham said in a statement: \"Jose is one of the world's most accomplished managers having won 25 senior trophies.\n\n        More from UK\n\n          * Prince Andrew: BT and three universities abandon ties with duke after Epstein TV interview\n\n          * Prince Andrew: TripAdvisor suspends reviews of Pizza Express duke says he visited\n\n          * 'Naive and trusting' Grace Millane gave list of fetishes to man on BDSM dating site, court hears\n\n          * Babies and mothers died in what may be worst ever NHS maternity scandal, report finds\n\n          * Harry Dunn: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defends seeking legal costs from family\n\n          * EuroMillions: UK ticket holder wins £105m jackpot prize\n\n    \"He is renowned for his tactical prowess and has managed FC Porto, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United.\n\n          Club statement\n\n          — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) November 20, 2019\n\n    \"He has won a domestic title in a record four different countries (Portugal, England, Italy and Spain) and is one of only three managers to have won the UEFA Champions League twice with two clubs, FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010.\"\n\n    Tottenham posted an image of Mourinho holding up a Tottenham shirt from its Twitter account on Wednesday, with the caption: \"Welcome Jose\".\n\n    Mourinho won three Premier League titles over two spells in charge of Chelsea and returned to England to manage Manchester United in 2016.\n\n    He was sacked following a poor run of results and has been out of work since, most recently working as a pundit for Sky Sports.\n\n    Mourinho, who also managed Porto, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, has turned down a number of opportunities to coach abroad, including with clubs in China, Spain and Portugal, since his Old Trafford exit.\n\n    His first match in charge will be away to West Ham on Saturday.\n\n      Image: Jose Mourinho, left, has replaced Mauricio Pochettino as manager of Tottenham\n\n          I can’t thank this man enough.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\n                Both sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\n\n                The released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\n                The Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\n                Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\n                “We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.”\n\n                The US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\n                When Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\n\n                He also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\n\n                Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are profoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’ family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\n                King and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\n\n                Both men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\n\n                US officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\n                Washington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\n                      Share this:\n\n                          * Facebook\n                          * Twitter\n                          * Flipboard\n                          * WhatsApp\n                          * Email\n                          * Copy\n                          * \n              Filed under afghanistan , hostages , middle east , prisoners , taliban\n\n                Share this article:\n\n                    Share this:\n\n                        * Facebook\n                        * Twitter\n                        * Flipboard\n                        * WhatsApp\n                        * Email\n                        * Copy\n                        * \n\n                  Read Next\n\n                  Teen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\n              Read Next\n\n              Teen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\n          Share Selection\n\n            Trending Now on NYPost.com\n\n             1.

               Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\n          Healthcare\n            I am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and digital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that order.\n        * Share to facebook\n        * Share to twitter\n        * Share to linkedin\n\n        How can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils? (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n        Getty\n\n        The Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n        Wondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.\n\n        For the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.\n\n        Here is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).”\n\n        At first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\n        Ah, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently “acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.\n\n        Breathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\n        A CT of his chest showed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\n        HP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather duvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird fancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called “pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\n        Wait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s called “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier lung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub lung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not always good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\n        Not all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n        Getty\n\n        The doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect within 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.”\n\n        Eventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.”\n\n        Fortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\n        So, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it’s the pigeons that you are breeding in your kitchen.\n\n        Before you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like “feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the slightest touch and you feel weak.\n\n    Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\n\n              Summary\n\n              This post will discuss the following:\n\n                * Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\n                * Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\n                * Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More)\n\n              Incubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\n              We summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\n              A key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n\n              We have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\n\n              We believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\n              For full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\n              We believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\n              Modeling cost-effectiveness\n\n              In addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\n\n              The main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\n\n              This could occur:\n\n               1. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\n               2. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\n              This grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\n              We register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\n              We incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\n\n              Our best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\n\n              Risks to the success of the grant\n\n              We do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\n                * Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\n                * We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\n              Going forward\n\n              This grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\n\n              We look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\n            Posted in GiveWell Incubation Grants | Permalink | 1 Comment\n                * Previous Post\n                * Next Post\n\n              Comments\n\n                    * Jamie Cassidy on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said:\n\n                    I am so pumped about this!

could make it easier to reach other planets.\n\n                The agency said Monday that its researchers examined how hibernation would affect the design of a crewed mission to Mars and concluded that it could help to significantly shrink the size of spacecraft.\n\n                While slowing down humans' metabolic rate similarly to the way animals hibernate isn't possible yet, research team head Jennifer Ngo-Anh says the idea \"is actually not so crazy.\" She noted that similar methods are already used to save trauma victims.\n\n                      Related Links\n\n

The health commission said in a statement that a 55-year old man had contracted bubonic plague after eating a wild rabbit during a hunting trip. The man was subsequently quarantined after the diagnosis, along with 28 people who he came into contact with.\n\n            Related articles\n\n              * Plague outbreak: China hit by ‘highly contagious’ pneumonic plague\n              * Horror as plague of killer mosquitos are headed to Britain\n\n            However, the other 28 people have showed no signs or symptoms of the plague.\n\n            The other two contractors caught pneumonic plague, with the difference being bubonic effects the lymph nodes whereas pneumonic effects the lungs.\n\n            Fan Mengguang, deputy director of Inner Mongolia’s disease prevention and control centre, told the media that the latest case is “isolated and unrelated” to the cases in Beijing.\n\n            However, with three confirmed diagnoses, the public is beginning to panic over a potential outbreak.\n\n            Yersina pestis causes the plague (Image: GETTY)\n\n            The plague wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century (Image: GETTY)\n\n            According to AFP, one user on Weibo, which is essentially China’s version of Twitter, posted: “I just want to know how these two came to Beijing?? By train, airplane, or did they drive themselves?”\n\n            Another reportedly said: ”Bird flu in the year of the rooster... swine fever in the year of the pig. Next year is the year of the rat...the plague is coming.”\n\n            The pneumonic plague is just one of three diseases caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.\n\n            Pneumonic plague is known for its effects on the respiratory system, as it causes dangerous lung infections.\n\n            READ MORE: China plague outbreak confirmed: Two diagnosed with disease in Beijing\n\n            Plague can be easily vaccinated (Image: GETTY)\n\n            Related articles\n\n              * UK weather alert: Plague of mosquitos to devastate Britain as Hurri...\n              * Bible bombshell: Scientists claim discovery of root of all evil\n\n            Yersinia pestis also causes bubonic plague - otherwise known as the ‘black death - which affects lymph nodes, and septicemic plague, which affects the blood.\n\n            Of the three plague variants, pneumonic is the most virulent and is fatal if left untreated.\n\n            In the 14th century the Black Death spread across the Mediterranean and Europe, killing up to 60 percent of Europe’s total population.\n\n            More than 100 million people may have perished - reducing the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million.\n\n            DON'T MISS\n            Plague and zoonotic influenza warning: CDC names EIGHT deadly diseases [WARNING]\n            BLACK DEATH PLAGUE fears: Holidaymakers die after eating marmot [INSIGHT]\n            Plane passengers quarantined after BUBONIC PLAGUE outbreak [NEWS]\n\n            A 14th century plague doctor (Image: GETTY)\n\n            According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the US, the plague is treatable with antibiotics.\n\n            The CDC advises the earlier people seek treatment, the more likely it is they will make a full recovery.\n\n            Those who come into close contact with plague victims may need preventative antibiotic therapy.\n\n            Trending\n\n            In the 21st century, the plague is endemic to select regions of the planet.\n\n            Three countries where the plague still circulates are the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, and Peru.\n\n            Isolated cases often also spring up in the US, with up to a dozen people diagnosed annually.\n\n          Related articles\n\n            * Major health warning issued after DEADLY PLAGUE confirmed in wild a...\n            * Plague blamed on Madagascar ritual of digging up dead relatives\n            * Major cities face plague of vicious bloodthirsty SUPER-RATS\n          China\n\n    Most read in Science\n\n    Latest videos\n\n      UK weather forecast: Terrifying map shows COLLAPSED polar vortex freezing UK in December\n\n      Flights: Passengers can fly for up to 80 percent less by travelling on this day\n\n      Royal wedding 2020: Will Princess Beatrice be allowed to wear a royal tiara?\n\n      Queen and Prince Philip spend 72nd wedding anniversary apart after health concerns\n\n      Rachel Riley: ‘It really matters’ Susie Dent speaks out on Countdown co-star's role\n\n      Archeology news: Major discovery sparks bidding war after ancient ring unearthed\n\n      NASA Moon landing: How Apollo 12 faced a catastrophic failure seconds after launch TWICE\n\n      Elon Musk’s SpaceX begins testing on groundbreaking Starship rocket to get humans to Mars\n\n      Meteor shower 2019: 'Few hundred' meteors are about to burst out in dazzling rare display\n\n      Life on Mars: Ohio University expert finds 'evidence' of alien bugs in NASA's rover photos\n\n      Lucky fossil hunter finds prehistoric sea creature inside ‘golden snitch’ on English coast\n\n      NASA shock discovery: Supermassive blackhole creating stars at a ‘furious rate’ found\n\n      Asteroid swarm: NASA tracks three large space rocks barreling towards Earth tomorrow\n\n      Asteroid warning: NASA reveals 10 dates 'God of chaos' asteroid Apophis could hit Earth\n\n      NASA shock: Veteran astronaut reveals what North Korea really looks like from space\n\n      Life after death: Scientist explains what ACTUALLY happens when you die -

News\n\n  A Man Develops 'Feather-Duvet Lung' After Switching His Bedding\n\n    By Yasemin Saplakoglu - Staff Writer 2019-11-18T23:30:00Z Health\n\n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      Shares\n      (Image: © Shutterstock)\n\n    A soothing pillow and warm duvet might not always lead to better rest. A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\n\n    The patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\n\n    The man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\n    Related: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction\n\n    His general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\n    After questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\n    Feather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\n    The patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n    \"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\n\n    It's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\n    When doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\n    That being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\n\n    The findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n      * 27 Oddest Medical Case Reports\n      * 10 Strangest Medical Cases\n      * 11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed\n\n    Originally published on Live Science.\n\n    Want more science?

By “tasting” the presence of certain pathogens, these cells may act as sentinels for the immune system.\n\n                RenderBurger for Quanta Magazine\n\n                            Carrie Arnold\n\n                            Contributing Writer\n\n                          November 15, 2019\n\n                          View PDF/Print Mode\n                          biology cell biology immunology\n\n                          When the immunologist De’Broski Herbert at the University of Pennsylvania looked deep inside the lungs of mice infected with influenza, he thought he was seeing things. He had found a strange-looking cell with a distinctive thatch of projections like dreadlocks atop a pear-shaped body, and it was studded with taste receptors. He recalled that it looked just like a tuft cell — a cell type most often associated with the lining of the intestines.\n\n                          But what would a cell covered with taste receptors be doing in the lungs? And why did it only appear there in response to a severe bout of influenza?\n\n                          Herbert wasn’t alone in his puzzlement over this mysterious and little-studied group of cells that keep turning up in unexpected places, from the thymus (a small gland in the chest where pathogen-fighting T cells mature) to the pancreas. Scientists are only just beginning to understand them, but it is gradually becoming clear that tuft cells are an important hub for the body’s defenses precisely because they can communicate with the immune system and other sets of tissues, and because their taste receptors allow them to identify threats that are still invisible to other immune cells.\n\n                          Researchers around the world are tracing the ancient evolutionary roots that olfactory and taste receptors (collectively called chemosensory receptors or nutrient receptors) share with the immune system. A flurry of work in recent years shows that their paths cross far more often than anyone anticipated, and that this chemosensory-immunological network plays a role not just in infection, but in cancer and at least a handful of other diseases.\n\n                          This system, says Richard Locksley, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, helps direct a systematic response to potential dangers throughout the body. Research focusing on the interactions of the tuft cell could offer a glimpse of how organ systems work together. He describes the prospects of what could come from the studies of these receptors and cells as “exciting,” but cautions that “we’re still in the very early days” of figuring it out.\n\n                          Not Merely Taste and Smell Receptors\n\n                          One of life’s fundamental challenges is to find food that’s good to eat and avoid food that isn’t. Outside of our modern world of prepackaged food on grocery store shelves, it’s a perilous task. Taking advantage of a new type of food could mean the difference between starvation and survival, or it could mean an early death from accidental self-poisoning. Chemosensory receptors help us make this distinction. They’re so essential that even single-celled bacteria such as Escherichia coli carry a type of this receptor.\n\n                          Despite the near universality of these receptors and their centrality to survival, scientists didn’t discover the big family of genes that encode for olfactory receptors until 1991, with the ones for taste receptors following in 2000. (The olfactory receptor discovery brought the researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck a Nobel Prize in 2004.) Olfactory receptors and taste receptors for bitter, sweet and umami (savory) are all part of a large family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are embedded in cell membranes. Although the precise details vary from receptor to receptor, when a GPCR binds to the proper molecule, it sets off a signaling cascade within the cell. For taste and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, this cascade causes neurons to fire and enables us to recognize everything from the rich sweetness of a chocolate chip cookie to the nose-wrinkling stench of a passing skunk.\n\n                          The discoveries of these receptors were momentous, groundbreaking advances, says Jennifer Pluznick, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But in her view, labeling them as olfactory and taste receptors rather than as chemosensory receptors entrenched the idea that they function specifically and exclusively in smell and taste. If scientists found signs of these receptors in cells outside the nose and mouth, it was easy to write them off as mistakes or anomalies. She herself was shocked to find an olfactory receptor called Olfr78 in kidney cells, a finding that she reported in 2009.\n\n                        Share this article\n\n                                  Copied!\n\n                          Newsletter\n\n                          Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\n                          Subscribe now\n                        Most recent newsletter\n\n                          Video: In this talk presented at the 2016 TEDMED conference, Jennifer Pluznick, an associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the diverse function of the scent detectors found in tissues throughout the body.\n\n                          TEDMED\n\n                    “I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, ‘I don’t even know that I can trust this data, you know?’” Pluznick recalled. “Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.”\n\n                    This wasn’t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\n\n                    But then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions.\n\n                    Receptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert’s colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections.\n\n                    Meanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney’s secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure. “Other labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,” Pluznick said.\n\n                    These studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove home the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to “taste” and “smell” minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host’s defenses.\n\n                    A Job for Tuft Cells\n\n                    In researchers’ assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn’t led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren’t contributing to our sense of taste.\n\n                    As a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. “They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn’t really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,” said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells’ function, and he eventually got his answer — through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\n\n                    Because some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\n\n                    But surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected — specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\n\n                    Howitt realized that T. muris wasn’t an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice — something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. “We weren’t looking for protozoa,” Howitt said. “We were focused on bacteria.”\n\n                    To confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\n\n                    The numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn’t happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\n\n                    Howitt’s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body’s defenses — one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists’ understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett’s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\n\n                    At the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\n                    “Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,” he said.\n\n                    The Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature, respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\n\n                    For the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, “people just kind of ignored them or didn’t even realize that they were there,” said Megan Baldridge, a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n                    As groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body’s invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system’s maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen’s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\n\n                    As a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert’s at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs’ recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\n\n                In a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection, newly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears at right). Tuft cells don’t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to emerge as part of the body’s response against the infection.\n\n                Courtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\n                    “Sure enough, they were all over the place,” Vaughan said. But the tuft cells only appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he and Herbert were “basically seeing a cell type where [it’s] not supposed to be.” Although he’s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens after the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body’s attempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune response.\n\n                    The researchers don’t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or what they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually “taste” the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for the body to respond to even minute threats.\n\n                    The tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products present in microenvironments within the body. “Once some of those metabolic products go out of whack … bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a response if something is wrong.”\n\n                    Newly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous systems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose tools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell. It isn’t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all evolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of “taste” receptors on the tongue first, “that doesn’t mean that’s the order in which it evolved.”\n\n                    In fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors’ immune functions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as monocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to detect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed that rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts suggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent receptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of other groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\n\n                    Whatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these receptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them for any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft cells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the invaders before they’ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the sudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not always present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\n                    “You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,” he said. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and asthma: There could be dangers “if you have too many of these cells and they’re too poised to respond to the external environment.”\n\n                    Correction added Nov. 18, 2019: The caption below the photograph of Herbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to observe the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice.\n\n                    This article was reprinted on Wired.com.\n\n                            Carrie Arnold\n\n                            Contributing Writer\n\n                          November 15, 2019\n\n                          View PDF/Print Mode\n                          biology cell biology immunology\n\n                        Share this article\n\n                                  Copied!\n\n                          Newsletter\n\n                          Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\n                          Subscribe now\n                        Most recent newsletter\n\n            The Quanta Newsletter\n\n            Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\n                Subscribe\n\n            Most recent newsletter\n\n          Comment on this article\n\n                  Quanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010.\n\n                    Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012.\n\n                    The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions.\n\n                    He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London.\n\n                      * Profile: Julian Assange\n                      * Timeline of saga\n\n                    The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but was re-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy.\n\n                    Separately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010.\n\n                    What did the prosecutors say?\n\n                    Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to \"discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange\", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said.\n\n                    \"The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,\" it added.\n\n                    Image copyright EPA\n\n                    Image caption Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses\n\n                    Ms Persson said: \"I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events.\n\n                    \"Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.\"\n\n                        Media playback is unsupported on your device\n\n                    Media caption Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London\n\n                    Prosecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case.\n\n                    One chapter over, another barely begun\n\n                    Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent\n\n                    With the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\n\n                    The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police.\n\n                    Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail.\n\n                    From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US.\n\n                    What was the Swedish investigation about?\n\n                    Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\n\n                    He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\n                    What has the reaction been?\n\n                    There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation.\n\n                    Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.\"\n\n                    What charges does Assange face in the US?\n\n                    Australian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US.\n\n                    He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.\n\n                      * How likely is an Assange conviction in US?\n\n                    In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US.\n\n                    Image copyright Reuters\n\n                    Image caption Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London\n\n                    Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term.\n\n                    But a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition hearing because of his \"history of absconding\".\n\n                    Last month, a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.\n\n                      Related Topics\n\n                        * Sweden\n                        * Wikileaks\n                        * United States\n                        * Julian Assange\n\n                  Share this story About sharing\n\n                    * Email\n                    * Facebook\n                    * Messenger\n                    * Messenger\n                    * Twitter\n                    * Pinterest\n                    * WhatsApp\n                    * LinkedIn\n\n                      More on this story\n\n                              * Video Julian Assange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy\n                                  11 April 2019\n                              * Video 'Misrule of law': Pamela Anderson's jail visit to Julian Assange\n                                  7 May 2019\n                              * Julian Assange doesn't consent to US extradition, court hears\n                                  2 May 2019\n                              * Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker?\n                                  19 November 2019\n                              * Julian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man?\n                                  12 April 2019\n\n                  Top Stories\n\n                  Wave of Israeli strikes hit Iran's forces in Syria\n\n                  Israel's military says the strikes inside Syria were in response to rockets fired by Iranian troops.\n\n                    20 November 2019\n                  Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him\n                    20 November 2019\n                  Suspect in Malta journalist murder held on yacht\n                    20 November 2019\n\n                  Features\n\n                      How a vote in Ethiopia could test Nobel prize winner\n\n                              Video\n\n                      Meet the women on a mission to clear landmines\n\n                              Video\n\n                      Three tips to win an election debate\n\n                      Why do billions of people still not have glasses?\n\n                      How to buy an Instagram following\n\n                      Amazon gets closer to getting Alexa everywhere\n\n                      Zimbabwe -

We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing backlash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response was concern.\n\n      Hege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding firm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign “Starts with one.”\n\n      “I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of attention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the end of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good evaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel concerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the behaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\n\n      When developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third year in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences, working with them directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values regarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior is much more difficult, Hege said.\n\n      “It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the most important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege said. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a positive impact in the world.”\n\n      While the “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n\n      “When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not intended to see it,” Graham said.\n\n      Graham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n\n      “You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they might think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a specific population.”\n\n      Targeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n      “We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot of young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.”\n\n      Jeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise eyebrows.\n\n      On Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings and other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n      “OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about? South Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.”\n\n      Sanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to try to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n      “The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.”\n\n      Wordcount: 717\n    Published: Nov. 19, 2019, 6:18 p.m. Updated: Nov. 19, 2019, 7:10 p.m.\n      Tags: ads, advertisement, awareness, meth, methamphetamine, nation, news, south dakota\n\n          Subscribe to the Morning Review newsletter\n\n          Get the day’s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by subscribing to our newsletter.\n\n              You have been successfully subscribed!\n              There was a problem subscribing you to the newsletter.

During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\n        “As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\n        Each defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n\n        The conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n        Noel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n\n        Epstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n\n        His suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\n        Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\n        As the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\n        Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\n        \"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\n\n        Prosecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\n        Sasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n        \"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n        \"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\n\n        Hawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\n        \"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n\n        Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n\n        Although representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n\n        Internal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\n\n        Investigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\n        Before New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n\n        For months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\n        Tuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\n        \"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n\n        Roughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\n        Defense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\n        Montell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n        “We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\n\n        Sometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\n        Figgins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\n        Prisons plagued by understaffing\n\n        Prison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n\n        Staffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\n        At the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\n        Ten of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n\n        After Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\n        Hawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n\n        Many of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\n        After the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\n\n        Epstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\n              This March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\n              New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP\n\n        Epstein removed from suicide watch\n\n        Three weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\n\n        Experts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n        “When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n\n        Boesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n\n        Jack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n        “Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”\n\n        Contributing: Kristine Phillips\n\n          Published 7:07 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\n\n    Terms of Service Privacy Notice\n    © Copyright Gannett 2018"

JOSEPH, Mich. (AP) — Michigan health authorities are reporting a 6th fatality linked to Eastern Equine Encephalitis.\n\n        Berrien County Health Department officials said Monday the victim was one of two people who contracted the mosquito borne virus. The death occurred Saturday.\n\n        Cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis first appeared in West Michigan at the end of August. The virus has been reported in Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties. The outbreak has resulted in 10 human cases and 46 animal cases.\n\n        Dr. Joneigh Khaldun of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the risk from the virus continues because there hasn’t been a sustained period of freezing temperatures. He says residents in the affected areas should continue to take precautions against mosquito bites.\n\n        © 2019 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,” Cooke said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      The SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.                                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      Recently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      That criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s own party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.                                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      He raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      “While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      He and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      That is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee.

José Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.                                                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n      “It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said.

The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n    \"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\n    Related: SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures\n\n    The five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018, bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\n    The newly selected five are:\n\n          Image 1 of 5\n\n            NASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help return astronauts to the moon in 2024.\n\n            (Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)\n\n          Image 2 of 5\n\n            An artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.\n\n            (Image credit: Blue Origin)\n\n          Image 3 of 5\n\n            This Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's commercial lunar lander for NASA.\n\n            (Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)\n\n          Image 4 of 5\n\n            An artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the moon's surface.\n\n            (Image credit: Ceres Robotics)\n\n          Image 5 of 5\n\n            This illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.\n\n            (Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)\n\n      * Blue Origin, Kent, Washington\n      * Ceres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\n      * Sierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\n      * SpaceX, Hawthorne, California\n      * Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\n    They include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly massive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\n\n    \"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\n\n    Blue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\n    Sierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\n    NASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\n    NASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n    \"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\n    In July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\n    \"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\n\n    Artemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\n\n    Such activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\n\n    NASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n\n      * Moon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\n      * Here's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\n      * NASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\n    Editor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details from the NASA telecon.\n\n    Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him @tariqjmalik.

the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives concluded its third public hearing on the impeachment proceedings against him for allegedly abusing his office for political gain in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\n                    The impeachment hearings are an effort by Democrats to establish whether Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing a corruption inquiry into Joe Biden, Trump's leading Democratic rival in the poll.\n\n                    The Democrats are alleging that Trump's call with his Ukrainian counterpart was irregular and inappropriate and abuse of his office for political gain. \"A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country! In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,” Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\n                    In the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\n                    Later in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\n                    The White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n                    \"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats’ central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n                    “Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that ‘there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\n\n                    Grisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\n\n                    “With the Democrats’ poll-tested ‘quid-pro-quo’ and ‘bribery’ narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,” Grisham said.\n\n                    “We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate ‘impeachment’ proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime,” she added.\n\n                    Grisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\n\n                    “Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,” Grisham said.\n\n                    However, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump’s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\n                    Volker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\n\n                    “Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,” Vindman said.\n\n                    Williams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n                    “I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,” she said.\n\n                    “I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,” Williams said.\n\n                    “I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,” she said in response to a question.\n\n                    During the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n                    “We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,” Volker said.\n\n                DH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n                  GET IT\n                Donald Trump\n                White House\n                Ukraine\n                USA\n\n\n\n\n              Comments (+)\n\n\n                  Related stories\n\n                        Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n                        150 Indians deported from US land at Delhi airport...\n\n                        Diehards remain at HK campus as foreign pressure grows...\n\n                        US, China fossil fuel polluters far off climate targets...\n\n                        'Climate impacts to cost world $7.9 trillion by 2050'...\n\n                        Oil prices steady after 2-day drop amid growth concerns...\n\n              DH Picks\n\n                  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr...\n\n                  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n\n                  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams...\n\n                  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n\n                  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes...\n\n              social feed\n\n                    What does your star sign say?\n\n                    Explore\n\n          National\n\n              * Politics\n              * North and Central\n              * South\n              * East and Northeast\n              * West\n\n          Karnataka\n\n              * Top Stories\n              * Politics\n              * Districts\n\n          Bengaluru\n\n              * Top Stories\n              * Bengaluru Crime\n              * Politics\n              * Infrastructure\n              * Life in the City\n\n          Sports\n\n              * Cricket\n              * ICC World Cup 2019\n              * Formula 1 with DH\n              * Football\n              * Tennis\n              * Sportscene\n              * Other Sports\n\n          Business\n\n              * Business News\n              * Budget 2019\n              * Economy & Business\n              * Family Finance\n              * Technology\n              * DH Wheels\n\n          Multimedia\n\n              * Videos\n              * Photos\n\n          Opinion\n\n              * DH Views\n              * Editorials\n              * Panorama\n              * Comment\n              * In Perspective\n              * Right in the Middle\n\n          Entertainment\n\n              * Entertainment News\n              * DH Talkies\n              * Arts, Books & Culture\n\n          Maharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\n          Karnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\n          India vs Bangladesh\n\n          Chandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\n          Ayodhya verdict\n\n          Pegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\n            DH Picks\n\n          * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep\n          * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n          * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n          * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n          * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\n            Latest stories\n\n          * Pawar meets Modi, briefs on farm crisis in Maharashtra\n          * A Dhankhar-shaped question around the role of governors\n          * Don't mix politics and security to leaders: Cong in RS\n          * Vodafone Idea, Airtel rally for 4th consecutive season\n          * RIL market cap inches closer to Rs 10 lakh crore\n\n            Trending news\n\n          * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n          * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n          * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n          * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n          * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\n            Services\n\n          * About\n          * Epaper\n          * Newsletter\n          * Archives\n          * Sitemap\n          * Classifieds\n          * Contact\n\n            Our group sites\n\n          * Printers Mysore\n          * Prajavani\n          * Sudha\n          * Mayura\n          * Privacy Policy\n          * Terms\n          * Disclaimer\n        © 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n          * \n          * \n          * \n          * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n      * \n          * X Share via\n              + \n              + \n              + \n              + \n            Share permalink\n\n  We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\n      There are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren’t always the right gift.\n\n      That’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\n      But there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve received for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\n      Satechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\n      Apple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\n      The only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit while charging in the car.\n\n      Satechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even during use.\n\n      It’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\n\n      Anker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\n\n      RAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\n      It’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\n\n      Thanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\n\n      RAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\n\n      The $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\n      The all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\n\n      Mophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\n      This is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\n      While no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\n\n      Mophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\n\n      This has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\n      Prior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\n\n      Even with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods, Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\n\n      Samsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\n      Speaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\n      Samsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\n      Recent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\n\n      On the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\n\n      For context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 before you factor the cost of a new TV.\n\n      I’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\n\n      Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\n      Wi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\n      Prior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\n\n      Then the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\n\n      If you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\n\n      I’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\n      If Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack.\n\n      Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\n      My two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\n\n      I needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\n      Then the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside the $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\n\n      My favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\n      The MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\n      Then there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro and my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\n\n      Brydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\n      Apple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\n      Brydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\n\n      My wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even after a keyboard repair.\n\n      Naturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio. iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\n\n      Brydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\n\n      It may not be for me, but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\n      Looking for more gift recommendations?

Credit: SpaceX\n\n          WASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\n          NASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\n          This “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n\n          “We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\n\n          The largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n\n          “We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo capability.\n\n          Shotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping stone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with people on board.\n\n          Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\n\n          Blue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\n          NASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\n          Michael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\n\n          Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something smaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined to say when his company’s lander would be ready.\n\n          The five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later, citing internal business issues.\n\n          Clarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two “deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\n            Commercial Blue OriginCeres RoboticsCLPSlunar landerSierra Nevada Corp.SpaceXTyvak\n\n      Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n        Search\n    * \n    * \n\n    * Most Read\n\n    * Upcoming Events\n\n            Upcoming Events\n\n            See All arrow\n                Nov 20\n\n                APSCC Satellite Conference & Exhibition\n\n                Nov 20\n\n                Space Tech Expo Europe\n\n                Nov 20\n\n                SpaceCom 2019\n\n    SpaceNews\n\n    2019 Spacenews, Inc.

The news organization, citing an anonymous government source, reported that President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs was dampening China's outlook on trade talks.\n              Japan's Nikkei 225 ( N225 ) declined 0.3%, while South Korea's Kospi Index ( KOSPI ) fell 0.5%. China's Shanghai Composite ( SHCOMP ) slumped 0.2%, but recovered those losses and was last trading up 0.4%.\n              Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ( HSI ) started in the red, but was last trading up about 1%. Hong Kong stocks have been trying to claw back some losses after last week, when the index recorded its worst stretch since early August amid worsening protests in the city.\n                  The United States once again kicks the Huawei can down the road\n              \"With no significant data releases in Asia today, attention in the region will remain focused on trade concerns and Hong Kong,\" said Jeffrey Halley, a market analyst with the research firm Oanda, in a note. \"Neither is likely to inspire the confidence of market participants.\"\n                  Read More\n                US stock futures were last trading slightly positive during Asian trading hours after recording small losses earlier.\n                A breakthrough in the US-China trade deal has remained just out of reach for quite some time. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been expected to sign a partial trade deal for about a month, but those negotiations hit another snag last week.\n                The US government on Monday did extend a temporary general license allowing American companies to sell to Huawei, the embattled Chinese tech company that has become a symbol of tensions between the two countries. It's the third 90-day extension of the license, which is now set to expire in February.\n\n              * \n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n          Search\n            * World\n                + Africa\n                + Americas\n                + Asia\n                + Australia\n                + China\n                + Europe\n                + India\n                + Middle East\n                + United Kingdom\n            * US Politics\n                + 45\n                + Congress\n                + SCOTUS\n                + Facts First\n                + 2020\n                + 2019 Elections\n            * Business\n                + Markets\n                + Tech\n                + Media\n                + Success\n                + Perspectives\n                + Videos\n            * Health\n                + Food\n                + Fitness\n                + Wellness\n                + Parenting\n                + Vital Signs\n            * Entertainment\n                + Stars\n                + Screen\n                + Binge\n                + Culture\n                + Media\n            * Tech\n                + Innovate\n                + Gadget\n                + Mission: Ahead\n                + Upstarts\n                + Work Transformed\n                + Innovative Cities\n            * Style\n                + Arts\n                + Design\n                + Fashion\n                + Architecture\n                + Luxury\n                + Autos\n                + Video\n            * Travel\n                + Destinations\n                + Food & Drink\n                + Play\n                + Stay\n                + Videos\n            * Sports\n                + Football\n                + Tennis\n                + Equestrian\n                + Golf\n                + Skiing\n                + Horse Racing\n                + Motorsport\n                + Sailing\n                + Rugby\n                + Formula E\n                + Esports\n            * Videos\n                + Live TV\n                + Digital Studios\n                + CNN Films\n                + HLN\n                + TV Schedule\n                + TV Shows A-Z\n                + CNNVR\n            * Features\n                + Freedom Project\n                + Impact Your World\n                + Inside Africa\n                + 2 Degrees\n                + CNN Heroes\n                + All Features\n            * More\n                + Photos\n                + Longform\n                + Investigations\n                + CNN Profiles\n                + CNN Leadership\n                + CNN Newsletters\n                + Work for CNN\n              Follow CNN\n                * \n                * \n                * \n          Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\n\n            Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\n\n                Published November 20th, 2019 - 07:50 GMT\n                    WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (AFP)\n                    Highlights\n                      She added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden’s attorney general.\n\n                  Sweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.\n\n                  “After conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the course of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,” Sweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on Tuesday.\n\n                  Persson explained that the complainant’s evidence had initially been deemed credible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made clear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened, primarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses’ memories had faded for natural reasons.\n\n                  She added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden’s attorney general.\n\n                  Assange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\n                  The case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\n\n                  However, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\n                  Following Assange’s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\n                  The journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\n                  Assange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\n\n                  The US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\n                  The US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n                  He now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\n\n                  This article has been adapted from its original source.\n\n                Via SyndiGate.info\n\n\n                Copyright © 2019 Press TV.

And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\n            Xi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass disorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security impotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's regime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine right of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to lead.\n\n            To be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want to send the army into Hong Kong.\n\n            They know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure otherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel Macron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither can Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party appears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears: resistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its global agenda.\n\n            And Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and manifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to Beijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of communications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence. But Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the protesters into new resistance.\n\n            Nor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the protests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to fall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A recent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal by the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively independent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between authoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\n            At the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are deluding themselves.\n\n            Unlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the American-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not years. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of individual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his Chinese dream. Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a year or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi will choose the former.\n\n            In short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\n          Opinion\n          Beltway Confidential\n          China\n          Xi Jinping\n          Hong Kong\n          Protests\n          Beijing\n              * \n              * \n        Share your thoughts with friends.\n      * \n\n              * More Washington Examiner\n\n                      + Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\n                            Anthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n                            Wednesday November 20, 2019\n                          Our family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago Tuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed and arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are highly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his nightmare will finally end.\n\n                      + What made Joker so popular?\n\n                            Madeline Fry\n                            Wednesday November 20, 2019\n                          Joker killed at the box office.\n\n                      + Sen.

David Perdue\n                            Wednesday November 20, 2019\n                          Wednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home state of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.\n\n                      + Surprise! Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\n                            Becket Adams\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Various outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study showed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S. detention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest rate of children in detention.”\n\n                      + Marie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\n                            Eddie Scarry\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          After three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so far with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of the impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\n                      + Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\n                            Becket Adams\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          It is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and personal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including Ambassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\n                      + Kurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\n                            Kaylee McGhee\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine policy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker sought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday, making himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n                      + Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\n                            Jenna Ellis\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          People are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment “scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly closed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his job. Here is what we learned:\n\n                      + Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\n                            Tom Rogan\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Beyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-Ukraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to Ukraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr Zelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n                      + First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\n                            Tom Rogan\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          The first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be held on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n                      + Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\n                            Tiana Lowe\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          The core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did President Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign government to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats attempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the pivot bombed fantastically.\n\n                      + It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\n                            Kaylee McGhee\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on Tuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not leak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n                      + 'Dictators': Europe is waking up to threats from China, defense experts say\n\n                            Joel Gehrke\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          China’s attempt to gain economic influence in Europe poses major strategic threats to American allies, according to defense officials, including one on the front lines of NATO.\n\n                      + Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\n                            Kimberly Ross\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Monday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no longer donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community left some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the militant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, continue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the announcement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold Christian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\" will not be satisfied.\n\n                      + Kemp Foundation embraces free enterprise's creative disruption\n\n                            Quin Hillyer\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Jimmy Kemp sounds a whole lot like his eloquent father, the late Republican official and idea man Jack Kemp, and this is a very good thing. The U.S. political world needs to start rehearing the Kempian message.\n\n                      + The kind of gay rights legislation conservatives should support\n\n                            Brad Polumbo\n                            Tuesday November 19, 2019\n                          Religious liberty and conscience rights are certainly worth defending against an increasing liberal onslaught. A female wax technician should never be forced by the state to wax a transgender woman’s testicles. Nor should a Christian baker be forced to endorse messages he doesn’t believe in. All have the First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech, and that right doesn't disappear when we begin to engage in business.\n              * About Examiner\n              * Magazine Archive\n              * Staff\n              * Advertise\n              * Contact\n              * Subscribe\n              * Events\n              * Newsletters\n              * Facebook\n              * Twitter\n              * Terms Of Use\n              * Privacy Policy\n\n    Copyright 2019.

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\n\n    According to The Verge’s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a statement…\n\n    Google Stadia Pricing for Games Available Now – Pro Subscribers Get Discounts\n\n    When streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\n\n    Not only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's revealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\n\n    Of course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t terrible. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles, it’s not a bad alternative. That said, Google promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet. Hopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience soon.\n\n    The Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a Chromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. More traditional free-to-play and premium subscription options arrive in early 2020.\n\n      Share Tweet Submit\n\n    Related\n\n      GRID’s Stadia Exclusive Mode is All About Endurance Racing\n\n        Alessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n          10\n\n      Stadia Launches Tomorrow as Google Officially Enters the Video Game Market\n\n        Rohail Saleem • Nov 18\n          11\n\n      Borderlands 3 Producer Was Actually Shocked at How Smooth The Game Plays on Stadia\n\n        Alessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n          13\n\n      Stadia Launch Line-up Almost Doubled – Extra Game for Pro Subscribers\n\n        Chris Wray • Nov 18\n          10\n\n      UK Labour Party Proposes Big-Tech Tax to Pay for Nationalisation of Broadband, Free Fibre for All\n\n        Chris Wray • Nov 15\n          16\n  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n  PC Builder\n\n    Purpose\n\n    GamingWorkstation\n\n    Budget\n\n      $1000\n\n  Trending Stories\n\n    * AMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US\n    * NVIDIA Super Graphics Cards Coming To Notebooks In March 2020\n    * NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti SUPER Ultimate Flagship Graphics Card Rumored To Feature 4608 Cores & 16 Gbps GDDR6 Memory\n    * PS5 – Every Official News, Leak & Rumor on Sony’s Next-Gen Console\n    * Biostar Exec Says AMD B550 and Intel 400-Series Motherboards Are Ready For Release\n\n  Popular Discussions\n\n    * Intel Xe GPU Architecture Detailed – Ponte Vecchio Xe HPC Exascale GPU With 1000s of EUs, Massive HBM Memory, Rambo Cache 2466\n    * AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 8 Core CPU Available At An Insanely Good Price of $130 US, Get A AAA Game and Xbox Game Pass As Well 2245\n    * Ryzen DRAM Calculator Tool Author Not Receiving Ryzen 9 3950X or sTRX Samples 2083\n    * MSI Announces Radeon RX 580 Armor Series Graphics Cards 1919\n    * AMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US 1746\n  Subscribe\n\n  Wccftech TV\n\n        01:45\n\n      Finally, A New Half Life Game Is Coming Out?!\n\n        09:09\n\n      Need for Speed: Heat Gameplay [PS4]\n\n        01:52\n\n      AMD To Introduce RDNA2 Based Navi GPU at CES With Ray Tracing & More\n\n        11:57\n\n      Terminator: Resistance Gameplay [PS4]\n\n        01:27\n\n      Project Scarlett Won’t Be Out of Position on Power or Price According to Phil Spencer\n\n        01:53\n\n      Neon Noir - Real Time Ray Tracing On Radeon RX 5700XT\n\n        01:34\n\n      Analyst Indicates NVIDIA Introducing Ampere in March 2020\n\n        01:41\n\n      Kojima Believes Death Stranding Had Stronger Criticism in the US, Possibly Because It Flies Above Sh\n\n        01:37\n\n      Newest Gigabyte TRX40 Motherboards Are Going To Be Pricey!\n\n        01:36\n\n      AMD Radeon RX 5500 ‘Navi 14’ Graphics Card Aimed at Performance Segment\n\n        01:54\n\n      AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X 16 Core CPU Faster Than Intel’s Flagship Core i9 10980XE In Geekbench\n\n        01:51\n\n      AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X & 3960X Retailer Prices Confirmed\n\n        01:45\n\n      AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32 Core & 64 Thread CPU Listed Online\n\n        05:01\n\n      Red Dead Redemption 2 PC Benchmark Run Test [4K@60FPS, Ultra Settings]]\n\n        01:41\n\n      AMD’s Next Gen Ryzen Threadripper CPUs Announcement Planned For November 7th\n\n  Sections\n\n    * Reviews\n    * How To's\n    * Exclusives\n    * Interviews\n    * Deals\n    * Video\n    * Entertainment\n    * PC Builder\n\n  Topics\n\n    * Hardware\n    * Gaming\n    * Mobile\n    * Finance\n    * Software\n    * Security\n    * Web\n\n  Know Us\n\n    * About\n    * Advertise\n    * Contact\n    * Tip Us\n    * Careers\n    * Terms of Use\n    * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n    * Change Ad Consent\n\n  Follow US\n\n    * Twitter\n    * Facebook\n    * YouTube\n\n\n\n  Subscribe\n\n  Enter your email address to subscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n  Wccftech © 2019 NewAge ADS, LLC.

That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.\n\n              People who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame.\n\n              Regular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n              Fortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and with the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\n              Here are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\n              1. Ditch the diet\n\n              Fad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\n              For example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\n              Similarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\n              Instead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes.\n\n              Eat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.\n\n              Summary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.\n\n              2. Avoid skipping meals\n\n              Setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\n              Skipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\n              One small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\n              Another study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\n              Try setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\n              Summary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.\n\n              3. Practice mindfulness\n\n              Mindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.\n\n              This technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.\n\n              One review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\n              Another small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\n              Try listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\n              Summary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you’re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.\n\n              4. Stay hydrated\n\n              Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.\n\n              In fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\n              For example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\n              Similarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces (375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\n              Other studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss (10, 11).\n\n              The amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure you’re staying well hydrated.\n\n              Summary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating.\n\n              5. Try yoga\n\n              Yoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation.\n\n              Studies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating.\n\n              One small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\n              Another study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances — all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\n              Research also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\n              Try joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\n              Summary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.\n\n              6. Eat more fiber\n\n              Fiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer (16).\n\n              Some research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake.\n\n              One small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness (17).\n\n              Another study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\n              Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full.\n\n              Summary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger.\n\n              7. Clean out the kitchen\n\n              Having lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat.\n\n              Conversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\n              Start by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\n              Stocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods.\n\n              Summary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat.\n\n              8. Start hitting the gym\n\n              Studies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating.\n\n              For instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\n              Another study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\n              Plus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\n              Walking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating.\n\n              Summary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels.\n\n              9. Eat breakfast every day\n\n              Starting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day.\n\n              Several studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\n              Plus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\n              For example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast (22).\n\n              Meanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\n              Try combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\n              Summary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.\n\n              10. Get enough sleep\n\n              Sleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating.\n\n              In fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition (24).\n\n              Another large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\n              Additionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight (25).\n\n              Aim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\n              Summary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite.\n\n              11. Keep a food and mood journal\n\n              Keeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\n              One study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating (26).\n\n              Several other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to increased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\n              To get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day using either a journal or app.\n\n              Summary Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.\n\n              12. Find someone to talk to\n\n              Talking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.\n\n              One study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that reliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\n              Another study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was linked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\n              A good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which may help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32, 33).\n\n              Next time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted friend or family member. If you don’t have someone to talk to, eating disorder helplines are available free of charge.\n\n              Summary A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge eating and stress.\n\n              13. Increase your protein intake\n\n              Upping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help control your appetite.\n\n              One study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\n              Similarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced metabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite (35).\n\n              Try including at least one good source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes — in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\n              Summary Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1, a hormone that can help suppress appetite.\n\n              14. Plan meals\n\n              Planning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to prepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the remainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\n              In fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of obesity (36).\n\n              Meal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which has been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\n              Set aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your meals.\n\n              Summary Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.\n\n              15. Seek help\n\n              While the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan designed by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\n              Treatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to help get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\n              Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then develops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\n              Other types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy (37).\n\n              Antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications (38, 39).\n\n              Summary Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain medications can also be used.\n\n              The bottom line\n\n              BED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around the world.\n\n              However, it’s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and healthy lifestyle modifications.\n\n              Rachael Link, MS, RD on November 14, 2019\n\n          related stories\n\n              * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n              * Binge Eating Disorder History: A Timeline\n              * What’s the Difference Between Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder?\n              * Binge Eating Disorder: Understanding Your Triggers\n              * Can Antidepressants Treat Binge Eating Disorder?\n\n              Read this next\n\n                    * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n                          Written by\n\n                      Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common type of eating disorder.

News.\n\n                \"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an insider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have operational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\n\n                In the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\n                TAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN, BIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT\n\n                    Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on June 28, 2019 in Montecito, California.

Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\n                However, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\n                    Braun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s first six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s “Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP)\n\n                “At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”\n\n                On Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\n\n                The company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\n                      Video\n\n                TAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING' CLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE\n\n                \"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\n                \"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\n                      Video\n\n                \"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\n\n                CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n                Swift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\n                A rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\n\n                Fox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.\n\n                  Julius is an LA Entertainment Reporter for Fox News.\n\n                On Our Radar\n\n                    Gronk's SI girlfriend tells all\n\n                    'Bach' SHOCKING sex confession\n\n                    Arnold's love child recreates iconic pic\n\n                    Elizabeth Hurley doesn't age\n\n                    Serious allegation against Markle\n\n                    'Dukes' star: I 'didn't see it coming'\n\n                    How Elvis bombed at Opry\n\n                      Taste of Country\n\n                Trending in Entertainment\n\n                      * 'Bachelor' alum Amanda Stanton says parenting makes self-care hard\n\n                      * Hollywood exec suggested Julia Roberts should play Harriet Tubman\n\n                      * Kelly Clarkson laughs off 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' backlash: 'We didn't kill Christmas'\n\n                      * Tom Hanks discovers he's related to Fred Rogers: report\n\n                  ADVERTISEMENT\n\n            U.S.\n\n              * Crime\n              * Military\n              * Education\n              * Terror\n              * Immigration\n              * Economy\n              * Personal Freedoms\n              * Fox News Investigates\n\n            World\n\n              * U.N.\n              * Conflicts\n              * Terrorism\n              * Disasters\n              * Global Economy\n              * Environment\n              * Religion\n              * Scandals\n\n            Opinion\n\n            Politics\n\n              * Executive\n              * Senate\n              * House\n              * Judiciary\n              * Foreign policy\n              * Polls\n              * Elections\n\n            Entertainment\n\n              * Celebrity News\n              * Movies\n              * TV News\n              * Music News\n              * Style News\n              * Entertainment Video\n\n            Business\n\n              * Markets\n              * Politics\n              * Technology\n              * Features\n              * Business Leaders\n\n            Lifestyle\n\n              * Food + Drink\n              * Cars + Trucks\n              * Travel + Outdoors\n              * House + Home\n              * Fitness + Well-being\n              * Style + Beauty\n              * Family\n\n            Science\n\n              * Archaeology\n              * Air & Space\n              * Planet Earth\n              * Wild Nature\n              * Natural Science\n              * Dinosaurs\n\n            Tech\n\n              * Security\n              * Innovation\n              * Drones\n              * Computers\n              * Video Games\n              * Military Tech\n\n            Health\n\n              * Healthy Living\n              * Medical Research\n              * Mental Health\n              * Cancer\n              * Heart Health\n              * Children's Health\n\n            TV\n\n              * Shows\n              * Personalities\n              * Watch Live\n              * Full Episodes\n              * Show Clips\n              * News Clips\n\n            About\n\n              * Contact Us\n              * Careers\n              * Fox Around the World\n              * Advertise With Us\n              * Ad Choices\n              * Media Relations\n              * Compliance\n              * Supplier Diversity\n\n            Other\n\n              * Fox Nation\n              * Fox News Shop\n              * Fox News Go\n              * Fox News Radio\n              * Newsletters\n              * Alerts\n              * Podcasts\n              * Apps & Products\n            * Facebook\n            * Twitter\n            * Flipboard\n            * Google+\n            * Instagram\n            * RSS\n            * Email\n          Fox News\n            * Terms of Use\n            * Updated Privacy Policy(What's Changed)\n            * Closed Captioning Policy\n            * Help\n            * Contact Us\n\n          This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\n\n        I know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set priorities.\n\n        Seek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\n        And you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at that.\n\n        2. Don’t forget to drink water\n\n        Staying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\n\n        Drinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they’re there.\n\n        3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\n        Most of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re feeling especially hungry.\n\n        But the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\n        That’s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, we’ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\n\n        So when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\n\n        Putting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\n        Keep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n        4. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip\n\n        Nothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\n\n        Because let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\n        So swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\n\n        And don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\n        Healthy Game Day Dip:\n\n        Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n        5. Go topless (with your sub)\n\n        Even small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\n\n        By taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories — about the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\n        Remember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “an open face is a happy face!”\n\n        My goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\n        Get started with 2B Mindset here.\n\n        Related Articles\n\n                  Weight Loss\n\n                Why Am I Not Losing Weight?\n\n                  Weight Loss\n\n                You CAN Lose Weight Without “Starving”\n\n                  Weight Loss\n\n                Smart Food Swaps to Outsmart Diet Deprivation\n\n          * Facebook\n          * Pinterest\n          * Instagram\n          * Join our newsletter\n          * Facebook\n          * Pinterest\n          * Instagram\n          * Join our newsletter\n\n      The information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community pages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a US audience.

Click to subscribe!\n              Which is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n              Remember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\n              In his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n                  Read More\n                At the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n                \"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n                Now consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\n                So, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\n                In December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n                \"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n                If it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\n                So, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n                (Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n                Given that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n                * \n                \"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n                Which is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n                This -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\n\n              * \n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n          Search\n            * World\n                + Africa\n                + Americas\n                + Asia\n                + Australia\n                + China\n                + Europe\n                + India\n                + Middle East\n                + United Kingdom\n            * US Politics\n                + 45\n                + Congress\n                + SCOTUS\n                + Facts First\n                + 2020\n                + 2019 Elections\n            * Business\n                + Markets\n                + Tech\n                + Media\n                + Success\n                + Perspectives\n                + Videos\n            * Health\n                + Food\n                + Fitness\n                + Wellness\n                + Parenting\n                + Vital Signs\n            * Entertainment\n                + Stars\n                + Screen\n                + Binge\n                + Culture\n                + Media\n            * Tech\n                + Innovate\n                + Gadget\n                + Mission: Ahead\n                + Upstarts\n                + Work Transformed\n                + Innovative Cities\n            * Style\n                + Arts\n                + Design\n                + Fashion\n                + Architecture\n                + Luxury\n                + Autos\n                + Video\n            * Travel\n                + Destinations\n                + Food & Drink\n                + Play\n                + Stay\n                + Videos\n            * Sports\n                + Football\n                + Tennis\n                + Equestrian\n                + Golf\n                + Skiing\n                + Horse Racing\n                + Motorsport\n                + Sailing\n                + Rugby\n                + Formula E\n                + Esports\n            * Videos\n                + Live TV\n                + Digital Studios\n                + CNN Films\n                + HLN\n                + TV Schedule\n                + TV Shows A-Z\n                + CNNVR\n            * Features\n                + Freedom Project\n                + Impact Your World\n                + Inside Africa\n                + 2 Degrees\n                + CNN Heroes\n                + All Features\n            * More\n                + Photos\n                + Longform\n                + Investigations\n                + CNN Profiles\n                + CNN Leadership\n                + CNN Newsletters\n                + Work for CNN\n              Follow CNN\n                * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n            * Terms of Use\n            * Privacy Policy\n            * Accessibility & CC\n            * AdChoices\n            * About Us\n            * Modern Slavery Act Statement\n            * Advertise with us\n            * CNN Store\n            * Newsletters\n            * Transcripts\n            * License Footage\n            * CNN Newsource\n            * Sitemap\n          © Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

Anthony Gonzalez told CNN's Jake Tapper something over the weekend that crystallized a question I keep coming back to when it comes to the Republican party's continuing loyalty to former President Donald Trump.\n\n              \"The cold hard truth is Donald Trump led us into a ditch on January 6,\" Gonzalez, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his conduct on January 6, told Tapper. \"The former President lied to us. He lied to every one of us and in doing so he cost (Republicans) the House, the Senate and the White House.\"\n              Yes! This!\n              Politics has always been a bit of a rough game. Politicians who win -- and help others win -- are lauded. Those who don't, well, aren't. It's transactional.\n              That reality is why I assumed that following Trump's 2020 loss, there would be a significant reckoning within the party about the last four years -- and a turning away from Trump.\n                  Read More\n                After all, that he oversaw -- and contributed to -- Republican losses is indisputable.\n                In 2018, Republicans lost 40 House seats -- and the House majority -- in an election that Democrats successfully turned into a referendum on Trump. (That Trump's approval ratings was stuck in the low 40s in the run-up to that election effectively sealed Republicans' fate.)\n                Two years later, Trump not only lost the presidency convincingly but also likely cost Republicans their Senate majority by spending the months after the election talking almost exclusively about (his lie of) how he was cheated out of victory. Democrats won two runoffs in Georgia while Trump was distracting the party base and, in so doing, recaptured the Senate majority.\n\n                        THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\n\n                        In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n                So, Trump came into office in 2016 with Republicans in the majority in the House and Senate. He left office in 2020 with Republicans totally out of power in the executive and legislative branches.\n                That record of losses should -- if history was any guide -- leave such a stench of defeat around Trump that no one in the party would want to be around him much less have him as their de facto leader.\n                And yet, here we are.\n                What gives?\n                The most obvious explanation for how Trump has managed to win despite losing is that he, well, never admits that he has lost.\n                After the 2018 midterms, Trump tweeted that he had \"received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night.\" Later he tweeted that \"those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well.\"\n                In the aftermath of his 2020 loss, Trump has spent months propagating the lie that there was widespread voter fraud that cost him a win. (Note: There wasn't.)\n                Trump's willingness to say up is down -- and for large parts of the Republican base to take his word for it -- appears to have created an ahistoric moment for the Republican party: They are following a man who oversaw widespread setbacks for the party over the last four years. And more than that: They want him to run for president again in 2024!\n\n              * \n                  * \n                  * \n                  * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n          Search\n            * World\n                + Africa\n                + Americas\n                + Asia\n                + Australia\n                + China\n                + Europe\n                + India\n                + Middle East\n                + United Kingdom\n            * US Politics\n                + The Biden Presidency\n                + Facts First\n                + US Elections\n            * Business\n                + Markets\n                + Tech\n                + Media\n                + Success\n                + Perspectives\n                + Videos\n            * Health\n                + Life, But Better\n                + Fitness\n                + Food\n                + Sleep\n                + Mindfulness\n                + Relationships\n            * Entertainment\n                + Stars\n                + Screen\n                + Binge\n                + Culture\n                + Media\n            * Tech\n                + Innovate\n                + Gadget\n                + Foreseeable Future\n                + Mission: Ahead\n                + Upstarts\n                + Work Transformed\n                + Innovative Cities\n            * Style\n                + Arts\n                + Design\n                + Fashion\n                + Architecture\n                + Luxury\n                + Beauty\n                + Video\n            * Travel\n                + Destinations\n                + Food and Drink\n                + Stay\n                + News\n                + Videos\n            * Sports\n                + Football\n                + Tennis\n                + Golf\n                + Tokyo 2020\n                + US Sports\n                + Climbing\n                + Motorsport\n                + Formula E\n                + Esports\n            * Videos\n                + Live TV\n                + Digital Studios\n                + CNN Films\n                + HLN\n                + TV Schedule\n                + TV Shows A-Z\n                + CNNVR\n            * Features\n                + As Equals\n                + Call to Earth\n                + Freedom Project\n                + Impact Your World\n                + Inside Africa\n                + 2 Degrees\n                + CNN Heroes\n                + All Features\n            * Weather\n                + Climate\n                + Storm Tracker\n                + Wildfire Tracker\n                + Video\n            * More\n                + Photos\n                + Longform\n                + Investigations\n                + CNN Profiles\n                + CNN Leadership\n                + CNN Newsletters\n                + Work for CNN\n              Follow CNN\n                * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n            * Terms of Use\n            * Privacy Policy\n            * Accessibility & CC\n            * Ad Choices\n            * About Us\n            * Modern Slavery Act Statement\n            * Advertise with us\n            * CNN Store\n            * Newsletters\n            * Transcripts\n            * License Footage\n            * CNN Newsource\n            * Sitemap\n          © A Warner Media Company.

Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, October 31, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\n            Time is not on Adam Schiff’s side.\n\n            A dam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\n            Yet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically inert.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            From the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\n\n            Schiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            One of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own doubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Schiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\n\n            Unlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            At this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\n\n            Most of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Yet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\n\n            And why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            What would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama before the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Most significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Each day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\n\n            Day-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\n\n            Each day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\n\n            Ironically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\n\n            Schiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\n\n            Schiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already, just vote.”\n\n            Voters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\n\n            that’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\n              Advertisement\n\n            Once the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\n\n            So too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\n\n            It is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\n\n            In just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including his own party’s presidential candidates.\n\n            Nancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism.\n\n              Comments\n\n            When Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “hearsay can be much better evidence than direct” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks into the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s time to pack up the circus and leave town.\n\n                * \n                * \n                * \n                * \n                Comments\n\n                Something to Consider\n\n                    If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

Photograph by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\n        Shares of construction goods giant Home Depot are dropping in premarket trading after the company cut full-year sales growth guidance. But its lowered forecast isn’t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street. That’s good news for investors.\n\n        Home Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third quarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the stock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\n          “Our third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said CEO Craig Menear in the company’s news release. “We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.”\n\n          One Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a “seamless, interconnected shopping experience” for customers.\n\n          In a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a buying opportunity, according to the analyst. “Comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations,” wrote Matuszewski. “We interpret lighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments versus a softer macro picture.”\n\n          He’s not the only one who isn’t all that worried. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem points out a couple of additional reasons investors shouldn’t fret. “While certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the company] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains deeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,” wrote Fadem in a Tuesday research report. “Excluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been closer to 5%.”\n\n          Still, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe’s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%. Lowe’s reports earnings Wednesday.\n\n          Home Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results with analysts and investors.\n\n          Home Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.\n\n          Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n\n          Close\n\n            Home Depot Stock Is Falling After Its Earnings Release.

It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\n                          That said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\n\n                          How to retire early\n\n                          1. Define early retirement\n\n                          Retiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\n\n                          The first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n                          2. Take inventory\n\n                          Leif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n                          \"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n                          \"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n\n                          3. Establish your target number\n\n                          After outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\n\n                          Early retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\n\n                          This part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n                          4. Live below your means\n\n                          It's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\n                          Focusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\n\n                          Depending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\n                          Regular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n\n                          5. Leverage your income\n\n                          It's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\n\n                          Sabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n                          6. Max out your retirement accounts\n\n                          There's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\n                          Employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\n\n                          The only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n\n                          7. Invest the money that's left over\n\n                          If you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\n\n                          Many early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n\n                          Need help crunching the numbers?

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\n                          In preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\n                          Tommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n                          \"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n                          9. Research your options for health insurance\n\n                          Leaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\n                          Otherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n\n                          10. Make a backup plan\n\n                          No matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n                          11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\n                          Time and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\n\n                          As early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either.

CNN has reached out to the LAPD for more information.\n\n        Also Wednesday, police said at least four people stole $20,000 worth of merchandise from an Apple store in Santa Rosa, which is located about 55 miles north of San Francisco.\n\n        \"In a brazen daytime burglary in front of customers and staff, the suspects grabbed over $20,000 worth of merchandise from the store and fled the area in an unknown vehicle,\" Santa Rosa police said in a statement.\n\n        The suspects were between the ages of 14 and 18 and wore masks, police said.\n\n        The thefts come amid a recent wave of \"smash-and-grab\" crimes.\n\n        On Monday, at least 18 people broke into the Nordstrom department store at the Grove in Los Angeles and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, LAPD Chief Michel Moore said. Three people were arrested, he said.\n\n        In the San Francisco Bay Area, a group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing. And east of San Francisco, three suspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob ransacked a Nordstrom department store in Walnut Creek.\n\n        In suburban Chicago, 14 people barged into a Louis Vuitton store last week and fled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise.\n\n      © 2021 Cable News Network.
