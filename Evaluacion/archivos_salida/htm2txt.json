(Manu Fernandez/AP)\n\nAssociated Press\tNovember 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Associated Press\tNovember 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 MADRID \u2014 Rafael Nadal kept Spain\u2019s hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give the hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\n\nGranollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5) to seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nThe top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the series 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\n\"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win, otherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a good position to advance.\"\n\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight hours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court. Spain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia. Russia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.\n\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a position that you don\u2019t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match, we were under pressure.\"\n\nSerbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic and Britain\u2019s Andy Murray will make their first appearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the Netherlands.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group co-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also included a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd throughout the matches.\n\nUS FALLS\n\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after Vasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov defeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well, served well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American neighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\nFRANCE WINS\n\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year\u2019s Davis Cup runner-up.\n\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"We know we\u2019ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of confidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win but we\u2019re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\nARGENTINA CRUISES\n\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\n\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n\"It\u2019s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\n\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios\u2019 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur\u2019s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\n\nEpic singles wins give Canada best Davis Cup Finals start imaginable\n\nRyan McKenna\n\nShapovalov, Pospisil give Canada a pair of upsets over Italy at Davis Cup\n\nCanadian Press\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure of American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to influence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants sabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of the humanitarian convoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened families wishing to leave the camp.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSource: Russian Defense Ministry, October 25, 2019\n\nFalse\n\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\n\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s al-Tanf of controlling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bandit formations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\n\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patently false,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\n\nThe al-Tanf base\n\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153de-confliction zone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\nThe Rukban camp\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153U.S.-controlled bandit formations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT \u00e2\u20ac\u201c formerly the Free Syrian Army \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations are false.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontrol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 any actors there directly,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Simpson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely not true.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the source said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is patently false,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rukban is another example of the Assad regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Robertson said.\n\nHe added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Simpson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nMost popular\n\n1\n\nNo Proof Ivermectin Cut COVID-19 Surge in Indonesia\n\n2\n\nMisleading Claims About the Omicron Variant and Vaccines\n\n3\n\nRussian Admiral Re-Floats Kursk Sub Conspiracy Amid NATO Tensions\n\n4\n\nChina Denounces Lithuania Over Border Crisis, Ignoring Belarus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Role\n\n5\n\nIran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Atomic Chief Falsely Claims \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo Deviations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Nuclear Program\n\nBack to top\n\n\u2022 Follow Us\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Info\n\n\u2022 About this project\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Newsletter\n\n\u00a9 2021 POLYGRAPH.info All Rights Reserved.\n\nXS\n\nSM\n\nMD\n\nLG"

Chris Jackson/Pool via REUTERS\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 REUTERS / POOL\n\nSubscribe\n\nFinian Cunningham\n\nAll materials\n\nWhat was this British royal and his PR aides thinking of when he granted a high-profile interview to the BBC, supposedly to clear his name from association with sex-trafficker billionaire Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nPrince Andrew, the nearly 60-year-old younger brother of heir to the British throne, Charles, has reportedly told friends and family that the interview aired at the weekend was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great success\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nIn it, the British royal blankly denied having sex with underage girls supplied to him by the convicted pedophile Epstein who reportedly committed suicide in August while in custody in a US prison. The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\n\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an articulated lorry crash\u00e2\u20ac\u009d performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the expert warned.\n\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unbecoming\u00e2\u20ac\u009d behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in order to terminate his friendship.\n\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not close\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lack of remorse\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sympathy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with the victims of Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\n\nLawyers for Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\n\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\n\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\n\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time.\n\n\u2022 Columnists\n\n000000\n\nPopular comments\n\nAndrew WERE is Epstein? As sure as pigs can fly Epstein isn't dead.

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\n\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\n\nTrending News\n\nSupreme Court hears biggest fight over abortion rights in decades\n\nWhere Americans are quitting their jobs at the highest rates\n\nCNN suspends Chris Cuomo over texts with Andrew Cuomo's team\n\nAnti-vaccine televangelist Marcus Lamb dies of COVID-19\n\nStudents describe suspect and victims in Michigan school shooting\n\nDownload our Free App\n\nFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\n\n\u2022 iOS\n\u2022 Android\n\u2022 Fire TV\n\u2022 Apple TV\n\u2022 Roku\n\u2022 All Smart TV Apps\n\nFirst published on November 19, 2019 / 8:16 AM\n\n\u00a9 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\n\nThe formation of galaxies is a complex dance between matter and energy, occurring on a stage of cosmic proportions and spanning billions of years. How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nRelated: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through Time\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\n\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\n\nRelated: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n\n\u2022 15 Amazing Images of Stars\n\u2022 11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way Galaxy\n\u2022 The 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark Matter\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nNeed more space?

Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt\u2019s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\n\nAt the front, there\u2019s Audi\u2019s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It\u2019s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road \u2013 such as markings \u2013 with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there\u2019s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It\u2019ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi\u2019s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\n\nPower and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there\u2019ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They\u2019ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt\u2019ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to \u201cS\u201d and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It\u2019s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there\u2019s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select \u2013 with seven different drive modes \u2013 will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\n\nRange and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there\u2019ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there\u2019ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge \u2013 which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in \u2013 will also be enabled in 2020.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or \u201cfrunk,\u201d you\u2019re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker\u2019s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There\u2019ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi\u2019s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there\u2019ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it\u2019ll also be used to control a new \u201cfunctions on demand\u201d system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback \u201cedition one\u201d: it\u2019ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\n\nStory Timeline\n\n\u2022 Audi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n\u2022 2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve\n\n2020 Audi e-tron Sportback Gallery\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Reddit\tTopics AudiEVLA Auto Show 2019Luxury\n\nMust Read Bits & Bytes\n\n2022 Honda Civic Si First Drive: Much more than nostalgia\n\nBMW Concept XM is an unapologetic tease of BMW M\u2019s most powerful car\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey just resigned\n\nThe first Apple AR headset could be a much bigger deal than we expected\n\n2021 Audi RS6 Avant Review\n\nSite Information\n\nAbout / Advertise / Jobs / Tip Us / Contact\n\nPolicies\n\nEditorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2005-2021 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.\n\nSocial and Media\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 YouTube\n\u2022 RSS Feed"

He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Read in app\n\nSend any friend a story\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month.

In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trump tweeted before Election Day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people of this country aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying\u00e2\u20ac\u009d impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You see it because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going up and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going down.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You gotta give me a big win please,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said later. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory \u00e2\u20ac\u201d their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that Democrats didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state \u00e2\u20ac\u201d promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.\n\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate political fortunes.\n\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153committed impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication \u00e2\u20ac\u201d proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrongdoing.\n\nBut it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fishing expeditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d given the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It will house the local police force's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\" Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of civil servants, said in the statement.\n\nArchitects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for the building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials will pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior Ministry said.\n\nAlthough Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that it was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938.\n\nRecent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also perpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's rule.\n\nReuters\n\n\u2022 About\n\u2022 Contact\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 Careers\n\u2022 Ad Choices\n\u2022 Privacy policy\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\u2022 CA Notice\n\u2022 Terms of Service\n\u2022 NBC NEWS SITEMAP\n\u2022 Advertise\n\n\u00a9 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

(Paul Chiasson/CP)\n\nPete Borkowski\t| @PeteB_93\tNovember 11, 2019, 11:28 AM\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Pete Borkowski\t@PeteB_93\tNovember 11, 2019, 11:28 AM\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Milos Raonic has withdrawn from next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davis Cup Finals in Madrid with a back injury.\n\nTennis Canada released a statement on Monday morning announcing that the world No. 31 will be unable to participate in first edition of the revamped international team competition.\n\nRaonic has struggled all season with the back injury, only playing five matches since the Rogers Cup in August, where he retired from his second-round match against countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime because of it. The injury also forced him to miss both the French Open and U.S. Open in 2019.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very hard and disappointing for me that I will not be able to represent my country at Davis Cup,\u201d Raonic said in the statement. \u201cMy health has continued to let me down through this entire year and now once again. I will take the appropriate time to get healthy and I look forward to being back on court next season.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u201cI believe in my teammates, and I know they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give everything to secure Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Davis Cup title. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be following them very closely and I wish them the best.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nRaonic has only appeared for Canada in Davis Cup play since 2015 once, that being the 2018 World Group playoffs.\n\nWorld No. 94 Brayden Schnur of Toronto will take Raonic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place on the four-man team which includes world No. 15 Denis Shapovalov, No. 21 Auger-Aliassime, and No. 149 Vasek Pospisil.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very happy to be able to play in the Davis Cup Finals but, of course, I first want to wish Milos a speedy recovery,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Schnur in the Tennis Canada statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an honour for me to represent Canada in this team competition. We know every win will be hard-won but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to support my teammates and go all the way.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSchnur reached his first ATP Tour final as a qualifier in February at the New York Open, losing in a third set tiebreak to Reilly Opelka. He also reached three ATP Challenger Tour finals in 2019, most recently falling to his new Davis Cup teammate Pospisil in Charlottesville two weeks ago.\n\nIt will be the Toronto-native\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second appearance for Canada at the Davis Cup. He lost both his singles matches in the 2017 World Group Playoffs against India, although Canada won the tie.\n\nAuger-Aliassime and Pospisil have also suffered injuries in the last month, but both are still expected to play next week.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals will take place from Nov. 18 to 24 at the Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain. Canada is in a group with the United States and Italy in the 18 team tournament.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\n\nNadal, Djokovic playing for year-end No. 1 ranking in ATP Finals\n\nPete Borkowski\n\nDenis Shapovalov seeing results from footwork adjustment\n\nCanadian Press\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely no room for compromise\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\n\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no way out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched \u00e2\u20ac\u0153save the students\u00e2\u20ac\u009d marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\n\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\n\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberation Army took to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153voluntary clean-up activity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\n\nThe movement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153show absolutely no mercy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Belfastisation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the city.\n\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\n\nChina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\n\nTopics\n\n\u2022 Hong Kong\n\u2022 Opinion\n\n\u2022 Protest\n\u2022 Asia Pacific\n\u2022 Communism\n\u2022 Xi Jinping\n\u2022 China\n\u2022 editorials\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Reuse this content\n\n\u2022 The Guardian view\n\u2022 Columnists\n\u2022 Cartoons\n\u2022 Opinion videos\n\u2022 Letters\n\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Opinion\n\u2022 Sport\n\u2022 Culture\n\u2022 Lifestyle\n\n\u2022 Contact us\n\u2022 Complaints & corrections\n\u2022 SecureDrop\n\u2022 Work for us\n\u2022 Privacy policy\n\u2022 Cookie policy\n\u2022 Terms & conditions\n\u2022 Help\n\n\u2022 All topics\n\u2022 All writers\n\u2022 Digital newspaper archive\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 YouTube\n\u2022 Instagram\n\u2022 LinkedIn\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\n\u2022 Advertise with us\n\u2022 Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sonos Move. Galaxy Note 10. See what else made our list for best tech gadgets of the past year.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 By Jason Cipriani | December 24, 2019 | Topic: Hardware\n\nOur favorite gadgets of 2019\n\nWatch Now\n\nMust read\n\nThese weird gadgets are actually super useful\n\nI get a lot of weird and sometimes wonderful gadgets across my desk, and some end up impressing me by actually being extremely useful.\n\nRead More\n\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we saw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple impresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech companies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\u00c2\n\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along with the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to keep on an eye out for the best deals.\u00c2\n\nSome of 2019's best tech gadgets\n\nDisclosure:\u00c2\u00a0ZDNet\u00c2\u00a0may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\nApple AirPods Pro for $235\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been asking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple finally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new design sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments, and comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into a dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The screen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently attached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch that users love and embrace.\u00c2\n\nSonos\n\nSonos Move for $400\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment speakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable. With Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest of its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\u00c2\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon Echo Buds for $130\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have been well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds have Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and Android devices.\u00c2\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro.\u00c2\n\nApple, Inc.\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Apple\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what it did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an amazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that battery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get this year.\u00c2\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Samsung\n\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed, has a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep up with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your creativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\u00c2\n\nDJI\n\nDJI Mavic Mini for $399\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nThe Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package. With a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to believe it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and enthusiasts who love shiny new things.\u00c2\n\nFossil\n\nFossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Fossil\n\nThe Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a normal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient display that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your connected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\u00c2\n\nWyze\n\nWyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Wyze\n\nKnow when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway with the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to connect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\u00c2\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nOne of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The new Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to the side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control connected devices, ask questions or play music.\u00c2\n\nRing\n\nRing Indoor Cam for $60\n\n\u2022 See it now:\u00c2\u00a0Amazon\n\nRing security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been made primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and capable of helping you monitor your home.\u00c2\n\nLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into a shortlist is hard. Really hard. Surely, we left some of your favorite gadgets off of this list. Leave a comment and let us know what your favorite gadget of 2019 is.\n\nBest gifts for co-workers under $50 on Amazon SEE FULL GALLERY\n\n1 - 5 of 36\n\nNEXT PREV\n\nZDNet Recommends\n\n\u2022 The best MagSafe battery packs: Keep your iPhone 13 charged\n\u2022 The best cheap tablets of 2021\n\u2022 The 5 best Linux distros of 2021\n\u2022 Don't waste your money on these Apple products\n\u2022 Check out ZDNet's Holiday Gift Guide 2021\n\nAmazon | PCs | Servers | Storage | Networking | Data Centers\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n\u2022 My Profile\n\u2022 Log Out\n\n| Community Guidelines\n\nJoin Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nRelated\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Best holiday tech gifts 2021: Gadgets and gizmos for everyone\n\nHardware\n\nBest wireless earbuds in 2021: Our top picks\n\nHardware\n\nAutonomous trucks can drastically cut emissions (Here's how)\n\nRobotics\n\nDeloitte: Chip shortage will extend into 2022\n\nProcessors\n\nProductivity Commission wants software updates included in Australian Consumer Law\n\nHardware\n\nHow to use an Instant Pot or modern pressure cooker\n\nKitchen & Household\n\nBest Instant Pot 2021: Pressure cookers have come a long way\n\nKitchen & Household\n\nGlobalFoundries CEO: Chip supply challenge to continue in 2022\n\nHardware\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon rebrands: digits dismissed, generations are in\n\nHardware\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nYou agree to receive updates, promotions, and alerts from ZDNet.com.

Learn more\n\n----------\n\n(Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The New York State Attorney General (NYAG) is investigating WeWork, according to two people familiar with the matter, adding to a mounting series of problems that have turned the workspace provider from a Wall Street darling into a pariah in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe company, which is expected to lay off thousands of employees beginning this week as it faces ballooning losses, confirmed on Monday that it had been contacted by the office of the NYAG, Letitia James.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We received an inquiry from the office of the New York State Attorney General and are cooperating in the matter,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said a WeWork spokesperson when contacted by Reuters.\n\nA spokesperson for the NYAG declined to comment.\n\nAmong the issues the NYAG is examining is whether WeWork\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, indulged in self-dealing to enrich himself.\n\nNeumann bought properties that he then leased back to WeWork, borrowed against his own stake in the company, and had also planned to charge WeWork almost $6 million to use his trademark of the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u009d after the company rebranded itself The We Company.\n\nThe company shelved its plans for an initial public offering on September 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, its business model, and its corporate governance.\n\nNeumann had resigned as CEO the previous week. He also agreed to return the cash he received from the use of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology investment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch. SoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to fund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for some of Neumann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares.\n\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later this week in areas that do not support WeWork\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core business goals, said The We Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000 jobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.\n\nNext steps to shape the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future will be divulged in an all-company meeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization to grow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWork\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units.\n\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The company rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as it sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\n\nWeWork\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on Monday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with reporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell.)\n\nVentureBeat\n\nVentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\n\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31pm CST\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn\u2019t expected until next year, but the automaker isn \u2018t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.\n\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it\u2019s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe.\n\nThe MEB\u2019s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is \u2013 at 195-inches \u2013 about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it\u2019s narrower and lower.\n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it\u2019s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There\u2019s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph.\n\nAs for range, in RWD form you\u2019re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle.\n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW\u2019s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo.\n\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they\u2019re eyes opening.\n\nInside, there\u2019s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there\u2019s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it\u2019ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There\u2019s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW\u2019s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too.\n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that\u2019s still cost effective.\n\nStory Timeline\n\n\u2022 2020 VW ID.3 official as Volkswagen bets on electric\n\u2022 As VW ID.3 production begins, Volkswagen bets it all on an electric future\n\nVW ID.

Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he wasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\n\nRepublicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\n\u2022 \"My fears have been realized\"\n\nDay 3, Part 10: Morrison's opening statement 05:22\n\nMorrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.\"\n\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\nVolker: Biden allegations are \"not credible\" 03:05\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"\n\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\n\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.\n\n3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\nVolker says he used \"official\" channel 00:53\n\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"\n\n4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman 03:17\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.\n\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\n\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 Morrison's supervisor \u2014 to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\nVolker: Nothing unusual about hold on aid 02:24\n\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\n\n6. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\nMorrison on \"the Gordon problem\" 02:54\n\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n7. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\nTrump Impeachment\n\nMore\n\nGOP congressman who voted to impeach Trump will not seek reelection\n\nNeguse: Witnesses \"would not have made a difference\" in Trump trial\n\nTranscript: Joe Neguse on \"Face the Nation\"\n\nRepublican Senators acquit Trump for role in Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThese 7 Republicans voted to convict Trump\n\nMore\n\nDownload our Free App\n\nFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\n\n\u2022 iOS\n\u2022 Android\n\u2022 Fire TV\n\u2022 Apple TV\n\u2022 Roku\n\u2022 All Smart TV Apps\n\nFirst published on November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n\n\u00a9 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren\u2019t paid enough.\u201d\n\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state\u2019s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n\u201cThe crisis is now, and we need action now,\u201d Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. \u201cThe issue is funding, and the state has the money.\u201d\n\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn\u2019t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don\u2019t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\n\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, \u201cRed for Ed,\u201d in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state\u2019s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring \u2013 one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n\n\u201cWe get that you\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Bosma said. \u201cWe get that you are concerned about issues.\u201d\n\nTeachers didn\u2019t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb\u2019s 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\n\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state\u2019s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren\u2019t \u201casking for the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,\u201d she said.\n\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana\u2019s Richmond High School, said politicians have \u201cvilified\u201d educators.\n\n\u201cThey think they know better about education than us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we\u2019re in the classroom.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 Terms of Service\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Site Map\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie Policy\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper"

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\nJames Van Der Beek has been eliminated from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dancing with the Stars.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe former \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dawson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Creek\u00e2\u20ac\u009d star, 42, was voted off the popular dance competition on Monday in a tight race against singer Ally Brooke after performing two dances for judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba.\n\nVan Der Beek was eliminated in what host Tom Bergeron described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hardest judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verdict so far this season.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The difficult elimination came in light of Van Der Beek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that his wife, Kimberly, had suffered a miscarriage over the weekend.\n\n'DANCING WITH THE STARS' CARRIE ANN INABA OPENS UP ABOUT SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION\n\nVan Der Beek revealed the news of the miscarriage in a video package earlier in the episode, noting that he and Kimberly experienced every parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst nightmare.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My wife Kimberly and I went through every expecting parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst nightmare. We lost the baby,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Van Der Beek said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The little soul that we had expected to welcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You never know why these things happen, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been telling my kids. All you know is that it brings you closer together, it breaks you open, it opens your heart, it deepens your appreciation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said the actor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes you more human.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSEAN SPICER ELIMINATED FROM 'DANCING WITH THE STARS'\n\nThe news of the miscarriage came a month after Van Der Beek announced that Kimberly was expecting on a previous episode of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DWTS.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe actor shared a clip of his wife getting her first ultrasound with their other children in attendance.\n\n\"Hearing the heartbeat was something we never take for granted,\" the \"Pose\" actor previously said on \"DWTS.\" His wife has suffered several miscarriages in the past.\n\n'DANCING WITH THE STARS': LAUREN ALAINA IS CHANNELING HER BREAKUP ENERGY INTO COMPETITION SERIES\n\nIn his initial Instagram announcement of the pregnancy, Van Der Beek even touched upon the idea of miscarriage and noted there should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero shame\u00e2\u20ac\u009d involved.\n\n\"@Vanderkimberly and I have been through three of those first appointments to discover either no heartbeat, or no baby, and she wanted to share this moment.

Of the total participants who filled in The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half were female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9 percent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or ethnicity.\n\nThe team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by 2016\u2014Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon\u2014 and noted if and how often respondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis use disorder before and after the laws were enacted.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\u2022 Dangers of Vaping: Facts and Statistics on Health Risks of E-Cigarettes\n\u2022 Cannabis Could Ease Symptoms of Depression in PTSD Patients\n\u2022 These Are the Industries Where Staff Are Most Likely to Smoke Weed\n\nCannabis use disorder is where a person's use of the drug negatively affects their life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use so much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and spend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\n\nIn adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the past month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use isn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent to 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\n\nThe number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use disorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group in other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\n\nBut among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis use in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\n\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the relationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug. Getty\n\nMarijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause substantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to physical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment, decline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.\n\nSenior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use disorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic and social consequences.\n\nNeil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\n\nRead more\n\nNeil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\n\n\"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts should coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be informed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make informed decisions,\" Martins said.\n\nIan Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of Health Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: \"Although the researchers found that regular use increased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate to a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis. Even a small percentage increase in regular cannabis users can increase the risk of developing problems like cannabis dependence which services would be unlikely to have the capacity to support.\"\n\nThis graphic, provided by Statista, shows the U.S. states where recreational marijuana has been legalized.\n\nU.S. states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational and/or medical use. Statista\n\nHowever, he pointed out it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from observational studies such as this one. The researchers weren't, for instance, able to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used, \"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently which wouldn't create the same degree of risk as those using high potency cannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.\n\nHamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers and manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health benefits, and even basic information on strength.\n\n\"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely risk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at risk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time it is often too late,\" Hamilton said.\n\nBut he said the results also don't mean cannabis shouldn't be legalized, rather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support services need to be adequately funded and available, something other states and countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis policies.\"\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing, Submit Correction or view Editorial Guidelines\n\nThe debate\n\nColleges Should Be Allowed To Pay Their Student Athletes\n\nColleges Should Be Allowed To Pay Their Student Athletes\n\nBy Sean Gregory\n\nVS\n\nPaying Student Athletes Salaries Would Exacerbate Unfortunate Divides\n\nPaying Student Athletes Salaries Would Exacerbate Unfortunate Divides\n\nBy Cody McDavis\n\nGet the best of Newsweek via email\n\nUnlimited access (ad free). $49 a year\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nYou have 4 free articles remaining this month\n\nLOGIN\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nCHOOSE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION\n\nPREMIUM\n\n\u2022 Newsweek magazine delivered to your door\n\u2022 Unlimited access to Newsweek.com\n\u2022 Ad free Newsweek.com experience\n\u2022 iOS and Android app access\n\u2022 All newsletters + podcasts\n\nSELECT\n\nDIGITAL+ from $1\n\n\u2022 Unlimited access to Newsweek.com\n\u2022 Ad free Newsweek.com experience\n\u2022 iOS and Android app access\n\u2022 All newsletters + podcasts\n\nSELECT\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nBEST OF NEWSWEEK VIA EMAIL\n\nJoin half a million readers enjoying Newsweek's free newsletters\n\nEmail address\n\nNewsweek\n\n\u00a9 2021 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Editions:\n\n\u2022 U.S. Edition\n\u2022 \u00e6\u2014\u00a5\u00e6\u0153\u00ac\n\u2022 Pakistan\n\u2022 Polska\n\u2022 Rom\u00c3\u00a2nia\n\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Announcements\n\u2022 Archive\n\u2022 Corrections\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Editorial Guidelines\n\u2022 Mission Statement\n\u2022 Advertise\n\u2022 Copyright\n\u2022 Terms & Conditions\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookie Policy\n\u2022 Terms of Sale\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\u2022 GDPR Privacy Settings"

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\u00c2\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\u00c2\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\u00c2\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\u00c2\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\u00c2\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\nOur Latest Stories\n\nTNF: Cowboys vs. Saints expert picks and predictions\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 3 min read\n\nNFL Week 13 picks: Pats upset Bills, Bengals cover\n\nTyler Sullivan \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 4 min read\n\n2022 NFL Draft order with team needs, notable FAs\n\nJosh Edwards \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 5 min read\n\nRanking the AFC teams fighting for wild card spots\n\nJeff Kerr \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 5 min read\n\nRanking the NFC teams fighting for wild-card spots\n\nCody Benjamin \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 4 min read\n\nBreech's picks: Steelers shock Ravens\n\nJohn Breech \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 12 min read\n\nWatch Now:\n\nBrown says Rudolph deserves suspension\n\nBryan DeArdo 2 min read\n\nPrisco's picks: Bills reclaim AFC East lead\n\nPete Prisco 5 min read\n\nPlayoff picture: Chances for all 32\n\nJohn Breech 7 min read\n\nPower Rankings: Elite teams back at top\n\nPete Prisco 1 min read\n\nBreech's picks: Pats, Steelers in upsets\n\nJohn Breech 12 min read\n\nMock: Giants replace Jones, Jets add 'D'\n\nChris Trapasso 1 min read\n\nNFL makes schedule changes for Week 14 and 15\n\nTyler Sullivan 1 min read\n\nBrady reveals his own 'flu game,' favorite non-SB win\n\nBryan DeArdo 2 min read\n\nMVP watch: Brady, Rodgers surge ahead of the pack\n\nJared Dubin 2 min read\n\nTomlin, Harbaugh to make NFL history with 30th clash\n\nBryan DeArdo 2 min read\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Careers\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Mobile Apps\n\u2022 Closed Captioning\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookies Policy\n\u2022 Terms\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nSportsLine.com\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2004-2021 CBS Interactive.

All but four have now been released.\n\nPlague can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if not treated promptly.\n\nThe last major known outbreak in China was in 2009, when several people died in the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nIn May this year, travellers were left stranded in Mongolia after an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague killed a couple after they ate an infected Marmot.\n\nAuthorities in western\u00c2\u00a0Mongolia, which is close to the Russian frontier, instituted a quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nAmerican, Dutch, German, Swedish, Swiss, and South Korean tourists were marooned in Uglii as a result.\n\nHow is the plague spread?\n\nPlague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis - a bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nThose infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubaction period of one-to-seven days, says the World Health Organization.\n\nSymptoms include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, along with weakness and vomiting.\n\nThe two main forms of plague infection are bubonic and pneumonic - where bubonic plague has spread to the lungs.\n\nBubonic is the most common form and is where people develop painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes'.\n\nAt advanced stages of the infection, inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus.\n\nPlague is transmitted between animals and humans; by the bite of infected fleas; direct contact with infected tissues; and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\n\nThose suffering from bubonic plague have a 30-60 per cent chance of dying from the disease.\n\nUntreated pneumonic plague is \"always fatal\", says WHO.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.\n\nHistorically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality.\n\nIt was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe.\n\nNowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics.\n\nResearchers have pinpointed the earliest evidence of the deadly illness to a placed called Laishevo in Russia\n\nMost read in world news\n\nJET BOMBSHELL\n\nBrit MH370 expert claims to have found EXACT SPOT where doomed plane crashed\n\nPAEDO CLAIMS\n\n'Ghislaine was in the room when Epstein sexually abused me when I was 14'\n\nPRES & PAEDO\n\nTrump, Andrew & Clinton all flew on Epstein jet, pilot tells Ghislaine trial\n\nTANGLED WEB\n\nInside Epstein's global network as 700 unknown private jet flights revealed\n\nCOMING UP TRUNKS\n\nElephant tattoo has VERY X-rated detail - but can you spot it?\n\nExclusive\n\nDEBT TRAP\n\nInside China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdebt traps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costings BILLIONS as MI6 chief issues warning\n\n6\n\nThe city of Uglii was closed earlier this year due to some plague-contaminated marmotsCredit: Vesti/The Siberian Times\n\n6\n\nA couple in Mongolia in May 2019 who died are suspected to have eaten a Marmot - a large rodentCredit: The Siberian Times\n\n6\n\nOfficials were seen in Mongolia attempting to control the potential spread of the plagueCredit: The Siberian Times\n\n6\n\nFears of contamination broke out after a husband and wife died from the deadly plague in Mongolia, in MayCredit: The Siberian Times\n\n\u00c2\n\nTopics\n\n\u2022 Health\n\u2022 China\n\nYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMore from The Sun\n\nSLAM-SUNG\n\nSamsung 'kills off Galaxy phone FOREVER' \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is this the end for your model?\n\nBENEFIT BOOST\n\nUniversal Credit \u00c2\u00a31k boost to hit bank accounts TODAY in Sun campaign win\n\nis that it?\n\nI'm A Celeb fans rage as show only gets FIVE extra minutes after 3 days off air\n\nLITTLE MINX\n\nLeigh-Anne nearly bares all as she goes knickerless months after having twins\n\nFollow The Sun\n\nServices\n\n\u2022 Sign Up To The Sun\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Editorial Complaints\n\u2022 Clarifications and Corrections\n\u2022 News Licensing\n\u2022 Advertising\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Commissioning Terms\n\u2022 Help Hub\n\u2022 Topic A-Z\n\u2022 Cookie Settings\n\u2022 Contact Preferences\n\n\u00a9News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

Instead, they lost 24-17.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Lynn said, via the Los Angeles Times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, we needed to win this game today. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could control our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that way. I still think we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are going to need some help.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would probably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they\u2019ve played so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning records, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll win out. Lynn is right: The Chargers needed to win that game.\n\nShare this:\n\n\u2022 Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\u2022 Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\u2022 Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\u2022 Click to print (Opens in new window)\tPermalink\t35 Comments Feed for comments\tBack to top\n\n35 responses to \u201cAnthony Lynn: \u201cWe needed to win this game\u201d\u201d\n\nthelastchargersfan says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:34 am\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing we have no fans left because this is a dumpster fire.\n\njoetoronto says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:44 am\n\nIt\u2019s time for both Chargers fans to come to grips with reality, it\u2019s over yet again.\n\ntheprocess12 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:58 am\n\nAs usual too many mistakes by Rivers. As good as the class of 2004 QBs have been one of them always leads in INTs. With Hill out the KC offense doesn\u2019t look that dynamic against a decent D. Don\u2019t see how they can win 2 road playoff games.\n\nv2787 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:02 am\n\nRivers is done. Get a new QB, Chargers. Philip has hit the wall. You\u2019ve got a good team, but you need a QB who won\u2019t throw interceptions. That \u201cshot put\u201d style of passing that Rivers has isn\u2019t working anymore.\n\n4hourelection says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:06 am\n\nFeckless Chargers. Always the same.\n\nmargoadams says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:19 am\n\nAnother team suffering from a Super Bowl run hangover, courtesy of your New England Patriots. Demonstrates once again the incredible 20yr run the Patriots have been on.\n\nMortimerInMiami says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:23 am\n\nChargers are on the clock!\n\nsammievee says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:42 am\n\nIf you needed to win, understand that teams that needlessly spike the ball in final minute, giving up a valuable play while letting a beaten fatigued defense off the hook, usually loses that game. Instead, consider doing what legit teams do\u2013practice during the week while preparing a play just for that situation. Then come up to the line of scrimmage and execute the play as you are not going to get a better chance than you had on first down with 24 seconds left and the opposing defense in utter disarray. Reid was choking again with the game management, I think I saw him doing high fives when Rivers spiked the ball and instantly turning the odds of scoring on that drive from 80% to 15% with that decision to spike the ball in that situation.\n\nmroklahoma says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:13 am\n\nWhat\u2019s he supposed to say?\n\n6ringsandarapist says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:32 am\n\nDid anyone really think the Chargers would win?\n\nlonespeed says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\nPhilip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback. He looked as if he was projecting outward confidence, but he didn\u2019t seem to have confidence in his ability. Kinda like when you get tired at the end of a long golf round. It started to manifest itself in mental errors and forced throws that weren\u2019t crisp. Lots of batted balls and throws behind his targets. He might still be able to win a handful of games, but his days of leading a team to the playoffs are over. My guess is he retires at the end of this season.\n\ntheguiceisright says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:53 am\n\n\u201cYes, I need to bench Rivers\u201d*\n\nI actually don\u2019t think Tyrod is that bad, plus he looks pretty sweet in a chargers uniform\n\nC. M. says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:56 am\n\nObviously Rivers didn\u2019t want too\n\nsolo681 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nWhy did you not have a plan to bench Rivers, if necessary, just in case \u2013 you know, as it was necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\njjackwagon says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nTitans ran the ball right down the throat of the Chiefs D. With Gordon & Ekeler, it makes you wonder why the Chargers didn\u2019t do the same. Poor game plan?\n\nRivers is no longer a QB that can carry a team with his arm but they still think he is.\n\nshutupbrees says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\ntwo weeks in a row the Chargers run for over 5.0 yards per carry, but insist on letting Philip Rivers drop back 50+ times. He seems like a good guy, but he\u2019s done. He spends more time barking it up with opponents than any QB I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019d be funny if he wasn\u2019t abysmal in the 2 minute drill throwing arm punt after arm punt.\n\nBob. Just Bob. says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:01 am\n\nTime to put Rivers on the shelf.\nThe dude just doesn\u2019t have it anymore.\nHe\u2019s become an interception machine.\nHe\u2019s always been a risk-taker gunslinger type but it\u2019s now gone past ridiculous.\nHave some mercy, Lynn; bench him while he still has a vestige of dignity remaining.\n\n6ringsandarapist says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:04 am\n\nFather time just pulled out his whoopin stick.\n\nbobmillion says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:13 am\n\nThe Chargers desperately need an O-coordinator that understands the players they have, instead of being that young innovative guru of trying to throw the ball on almost every play, especially with no tackles, try running the ball. The Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC defense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they have a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in desperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of the year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can do, though Spanos will mess it up.\n\njbaxt says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\nTwo things\u2026 Why would you stop running Gordon?\n\nAlso, several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d picked the Chargers to win the AFC West.\n\ndevindenv says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:41 am\n\nChiefs Offense, without Hill, isn\u2019t as dymnamic \u2013 as the poster above stated. Is that any f-ing surprise? But to say they cannot win 2 road playoff games overlooks the fact that the O-line. last night, was the first time in 6 weeks they have Eric Fisher back and the starting LG was back for the first time 3-4 weeks. Furthermore, tey are still down their best CB and a starting DE. The Bye week comes at a great time for them. We shall see as they have OAK in Week 13 and the Patriots in Week 14.\n\nfartweasel says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:32 am\n\nRivers is done. He just hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accepted it yet. Great career, but his skills have diminished. Time to retire.\n\npatsfan4lifesbchamps says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\nAnthony Lynn is in over his head\n\npsi0016000 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:46 am\n\nThe Chargers should sign Kapernick and make him the starter for the WHOLE 2020 season. In doing so, they will put and end to this ridiculous saga between Kaper and the NFL, where both sides are at fault.\nThis will also make possible, the transition from a declining and pathetic would be Hall of Famer, to a long time ago Super Bowl Runner up. Who knows \u2026\nAnd then they should make a priority of ending up the 2020 draft, and 2020 free agency, with a boat load of OL, some of them being outright homeruns.\n\nOne last note : hire Dan Fouts as an assistant QB coach.\n\nHow about them Chargers !!!!\n\nWhy I Love Football says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\n\u201cTheir going to need help along the way\u201d ? \u2026 Man, the Chargers are going to need someone like Moses to lead them to the playoffs. I think Coach Lynn needed this win more than anyone in order to stay employed. Chargers and Bears are in a league of their own. They are stuck with no where to go.\n\nsmarter than you says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:07 pm\n\nWhat a worthless team, no history, no tradition, ugly uniforms, I\u2019d rather be a Bengals fan\n\naveragjoe says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\n\nThe look on Rivers\u2019 face after each of those four (count\u2019em, 4) INTs should end all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n\ngrumpysal says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:39 pm\n\nWatching last night\u2019s game was like i was re-watching their game from a few weeks ago (?) where Rivers basically did the same thing (INT on last play) \u2013 I wondered during that game why the OC didn\u2019t run the ball more and again last night.\n\nAfter being IN that game a few weeks ago, did the Chargers coaches think a different outcome was going to happen? I mean, do they even watch Rivers during the game? He was downright awful.\n\nMightyMidwest says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:18 pm\n\nMight as well take your ball & go to Sacramento, San Diego, Portland or wherever.\n\nMaybe Mexico City is an option?\n\ncafetero1075 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\nRivers has had bad seasons and bounced back. I think he can play well next year.\n\ncaptainwhodat says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 2:25 pm\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We needed to win this game\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u2026said captain obvious.\n\njjfootball says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 3:43 pm\n\nHis arm is a noodle at this point!\n\na1b24312 says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:34 pm\n\nMaybe JFisher wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad after all? I mean, at least you got to 8-8 and one SB\u2026\n\nGuy Hence says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:22 pm\n\naveragjoe says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\nThe look on Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 face after each of those four (count\u00e2\u20ac\u2122em, 4) INTs should end all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n==============================\none quick read of your post tells us that you dont know a damn thing about football, the HOF or who should qualify.\nRivers \u2013 even in his decline \u2013 is STILL better than your QB.\n\nraiderbeer34 says:\n\nNovember 20, 2019 at 1:29 am\n\nRivers has made a career at throwing that 4th quarter pick to end the game.\n\nbut I just want to say, who ever is calling plays for the bolts should of been fired after the Raider game, and for sure after the chiefs game.\n\nits horrible, but fun to watch at the same time haha\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.

Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying finished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's tournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for Ryan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the semifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro 2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA Nations League.\u00c2\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nThere's still a chance for these teams\n\nAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a spot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each path having one berth:\n\nPath A:\u00c2\u00a0Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath B: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland\nPath C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath D: Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus \u00c2\n\n*A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\n\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.\n\nClinching in November\n\nOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at Ireland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before, Portugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and Cristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one shot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories out of eight in all competitions.\u00c2\n\nCroatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia secured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout of Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern Ireland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\u00c2\n\nOn Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against Liechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\u00c2\n\nAnd earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot, and that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with the reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites. Below are all the teams that qualified for the tournament during the group stage.\n\nQualified teams\n\n\u2022 England (Group A): 10th appearance\n\u2022 Czech Republic (Group A): Seventh appearance\n\u2022 Ukraine (Group B): Third appearance\n\u2022 Spain (Group F): 11th appearance\n\u2022 Sweden (Group F): Seventh appearance\n\u2022 Poland (Group G): Fourth appearance\u00c2\u00a0\n\u2022 France (Group H): 10th appearance\n\u2022 Turkey (Group H): Fifth appearance\n\u2022 Belgium (Group I): Sixth appearance\n\u2022 Russia (Group I): 12th appearance\n\u2022 Italy (Group J): 10th appearance\n\u2022 Finland (Group J): Zero appearances\n\u2022 Croatia (Group E): Sixth appearance\n\u2022 Austria (Group G): Third appearance\n\u2022 Netherlands (Group C): 10th appearance\n\u2022 Germany (Group C): 13th appearance\n\u2022 Switzerland (Group D): Fifth appearance\n\u2022 Denmark (Group D): Ninth appearance\n\u2022 Portugal (Group B): Eighth appearance\n\u2022 Wales (Group E): Second appearance\n\nOur Latest Stories\n\nAC Milan vs. Genoa picks, how to watch, stream\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 2 min read\n\nSassuolo vs. Napoli picks, how to watch, stream\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 2 min read\n\nInter Milan vs. Spezia picks, how to watch, stream\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 2 min read\n\nLiverpool vs. Everton odds, picks, prediction, bets\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 4 min read\n\nJuventus vs. Salernitana odds, picks, how to watch\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 2 min read\n\nAtalanta vs. Venezia picks, how to watch, stream\n\nCBS Sports Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 2 min read\n\nWatch Now:\n\nTracking teams qualified for Euro 2020\n\nRoger Gonzalez 2 min read\n\nJuve back to winning ways as Atalanta romp\n\nJonathan Johnson 1 min read\n\nPower Rankings: City lead way, PSG slide\n\nJames Benge 7 min read\n\nCurrent land Sam Mewis via trade\n\nSandra Herrera 1 min read\n\nSerie A Rankings: Napoli firmly in front\n\nJonathan Johnson 4 min read\n\nHow United landed Rangnick\n\nFabrizio Romano 2 min read\n\nMessi questionable for PSG- Nice clash with stomach flu\n\nJonathan Johnson 2 min read\n\nCarrick to take charge of Man Utd vs. Arsenal\n\nJames Benge 1 min read\n\nFive young USWNT players who boosted their stock\n\nSandra Herrera 3 min read\n\nRoundtable: What will Rangnick bring to Man Utd?\n\nChuck Booth 9 min read\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Careers\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Mobile Apps\n\u2022 Closed Captioning\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookies Policy\n\u2022 Terms\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nSportsLine.com\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2004-2021 CBS Interactive.

Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u01532019 is just not as strong as 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.\n\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\nMost Popular\n\n\u2022 What teams are still in the running to sign Carlos Correa?\n\u2022 Travis Scott, Live Nation lawyer up after being hit with massive Astroworld lawsuits\n\u2022 Here are the candidates vying for Texas governor in 2022\n\u2022 Police: Florida woman offers sex act in exchange for Chicken McNuggets\n\u2022 Sheriff: Hunter accidentally kills his 11-year-old daughter\n\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.\n\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.\n\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles will be sold this year.\n\npaul.takahashi@chron.com\n\ntwitter.com/paultakahashi\n\nBusiness\n\nIn leaked email, Musk says ongoing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrisis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could bankrupt SpaceX\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere is no way to sugarcoat this,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he wrote.\n\nBy Joshua Bote\n\nLouisiana Supreme Court OKs $325 million resort casino referendum\n\nIn shadow of Texas gas drilling sites, health fears escalate\n\nBy CATHY BUSSEWITZ and MARTHA IRVINE\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey steps down as CEO\n\nBy MICHELLE CHAPMAN and TALI ARBEL\n\nTesla is hiring engineers to test robots in Texas\n\nBy Steven Santana\n\nMost Popular\n\n\u2022 What teams are still in the running to sign Carlos Correa?\n\u2022 Travis Scott, Live Nation lawyer up after being hit with massive Astroworld lawsuits\n\u2022 Here are the candidates vying for Texas governor in 2022\n\u2022 Police: Florida woman offers sex act in exchange for Chicken McNuggets\n\u2022 Sheriff: Hunter accidentally kills his 11-year-old daughter\n\nWritten By\n\nPaul Takahashi\n\nReach Paul on\n\nPaul Takahashi is a business reporter for the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Return to Top\n\nAbout\n\n\u2022 Privacy Notice\n\u2022 Your California Privacy Rights\n\u2022 Interest Based Ads\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Our Company\n\u2022 Careers\n\u2022 Advertise with Us\n\nContact\n\n\u2022 Customer Service\n\nConnect\n\n\u2022 Email Newsletter\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Coupons and Discounts\n\n\u00a92021 Hearst"

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of a larger pollution problem in India. Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nYet another cloud of choking smoke and dust descended this year upon the 20 million residents of Delhi as winter crept in, reaching \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emergency\u00e2\u20ac\u009d levels throughout the region. The dangerous, dirty air arose from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital region.\n\nIn November, Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter to describe his city as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gas chamber.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nDelhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states\nIt is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today\nI urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public health emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren.\n\nSome air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported that the air quality index earned a rating of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hazardous\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at points throughout November.\n\nAir pollution in Delhi reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unhealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hazardous\u00e2\u20ac\u009d levels this November. Berkeley Earth\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201d were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians.\n\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.\n\nWhy Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And in November in Delhi, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total pollution. Dust from the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction boom is also a contributor to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\nThese sources contribute to Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse in the winter.\n\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.\n\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pollution in November isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plugged up,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Apte said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It overflows with spectacular consequences.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nDelhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality. Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act.\n\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting \u00e2\u20ac\u201d burning crop stubble.\n\nThis satellite image from NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019. NASA Worldview\n\nOf course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just rural pollution that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution \u00e2\u20ac\u201d traffic, construction, cooking fires \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have also increased as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\n\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\n\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\nBrick kilns and factories were shut down. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\nIndia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Supreme Court also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires continued, showing that enforcement remains a problem.\n\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of shifts in the weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not policy.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air to slightly improve,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.\n\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution. Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Part of the challenge is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a character of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh no, you first,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, you first,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Apte said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution \u00e2\u20ac\u201d many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds.\n\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People will be up in revolt, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Prakash said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\n\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better. Ecological Economics\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Prakash said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.\n\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Prakash said. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.\n\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi. Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.\n\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem can be solved,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Prakash said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n----------\n\nWill you support Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explanatory journalism?\n\nMillions turn to Vox to understand what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the news.

For this years\u2019 edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme \u2018The Medium is the Message\u2019. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition \u2013 in the historical center of Amsterdam \u2013 which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\n\nCover image: artist\u2019s impression of the lighting installation by\u00c2\u00a0Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\n----------\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\nIvana Jeli\u00c4\u2021 and Pavle Petrovi\u00c4\u2021 (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh\u2019s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\n\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) \u2013 also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua \u2013 explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\n\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio\u2019s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli,\u00c2\u00a0Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\n\n----------\n\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years\u2019 exhibition revolves around the theme \u2018The Medium is the Message\u2018, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\n----------\n\nSome of the lighting installations on\u00c2\u00a0show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival \u2013 previews\n\nLight a Wish by OGE Group\n\nParabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo\n\nPortam Civitatis by Peter Snijder\n\nSpider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS\n\n7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019\n\n----------\n\nsponsored links\n\n----------\n\n----------\n\nMore in Amsterdam\n\nAmsterdam\n\nsponsored links\n\n----------\n\nSearch Inexhibit\n\nSPECIALS\n\nHow will we live together? 17th International Architecture Biennale, Venice\n\n58th Venice Biennale of Art 2019 | May You Live in Interesting Times\n\nThe design of everyday technology\n\n16th Venice Architecture Biennale 2018 \u2013 pavilions, program, events\n\nMuseums of archaeology and archaeological sites around the world\n\nVenice Art Biennale 2017 | info, program, exhibitions, and events\n\nExamples of digital communication technology in culture and education\n\nWood Architecture & Design\n\nVisionary computer designs of the past\n\n2017 Milan Design Week and Furniture Fair\n\nnew locations\n\nMantua and Cremona\n\nNaples and Campania\n\nChicago\n\nSan Francisco\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nTurin\n\nDallas \u2013 Fort Worth\n\nWestern Austria, Innsbruck and Tyrol\n\nSubscribe to Inexhibit\u2019s newsletter\n\n----------\n\ncopyright Inexhibit 2021 - ISSN: 2283-5474\n\n\u2022 About Inexhibit\n\u2022 Copyright\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Advertise\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookies\n\u2022 Newsletter\n\u2022 Cookie policy\n\n\u2022 HOME\n\u2022 Architecture\n\u2022 Design\n\u2022 Art\n\u2022 Places\n\u2022 myMuseum\n\u2022 Specials\n\u2022 English\n\n\u2022 Italiano"

The demand has US\u00c2\u00a0officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US\u00c2\u00a0farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\u00c2\u00a0maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US\u00c2\u00a0put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US\u00c2\u00a0Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US\u00c2\u00a0on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\n\u00c2\n\nDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribe\n\nFollow us on Facebook | Twitter | Dailymotion | YouTube\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\ntrade war\n\nTrade deal\n\nRelated stories\n\nZuckerberg's cash fuels GOP suspicion, election rules\n\nEverything you need to know global vaccine passports...\n\nUS women beat Brazil to win 1st Olympic volleyball...\n\nUS women win first Volleyball gold medal against Brazil...\n\nOnce lagging, Europe catches up to US in vaccinations...\n\nUS win seventh straight Olympics basketball gold\n\nWhat's Brewing\n\nFive youngest medal winners of the Tokyo Olympics\n\nShared gold, knitting: Memorable moments of Tokyo 2020\n\nMetaverse: A high-tech plan to Facebookify the world\n\nGoogle honours India's first woman pilot with a doodle\n\nDH Picks\n\nThreat to human rights highest in police stations: CJI...\n\nTerror outfits avoid detection using religion as cover...\n\nBoris Johnson threatened to demote Rishi Sunak\n\nIndia leave Tokyo 2020 with promise of brighter future...\n\nNorth Indian ex-CM likely to be Congress working prez...\n\nWhat's Brewing\n\nFive youngest medal winners of the Tokyo Olympics\n\nShared gold, knitting: Memorable moments of Tokyo 2020\n\nMetaverse: A high-tech plan to Facebookify the world\n\nGoogle honours India's first woman pilot with a doodle\n\nWhat does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 North and Central\n\u2022 South\n\u2022 East and Northeast\n\u2022 West\n\nKarnataka\n\n\u2022 Top Stories\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n\u2022 Top Stories\n\u2022 Bengaluru Crime\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 Infrastructure\n\u2022 Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n\u2022 Cricket\n\u2022 Formula 1 with DH\n\u2022 Football\n\u2022 Tennis\n\u2022 Sportscene\n\u2022 Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n\u2022 Business News\n\u2022 Family Finance\n\u2022 Technology\n\u2022 DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n\u2022 Videos\n\u2022 Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n\u2022 DH Views\n\u2022 Editorials\n\u2022 Panorama\n\u2022 Comment\n\u2022 In Perspective\n\u2022 Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n\u2022 Entertainment News\n\u2022 DH Showtime\n\u2022 DH Talkies\n\u2022 Arts, Books & Culture\n\nNeeraj chopra creates history at olympics\n\nState support needed for Olympic dreams\n\nCovid cases in bengaluru\n\nBloodstains on boundary\n\nTokyo Olympics updates\n\nDH Picks\n\n\u2022 Threat to human rights highest in police stations: CJI\n\u2022 Terror outfits avoid detection using religion as cover\n\u2022 Boris Johnson threatened to demote Rishi Sunak\n\u2022 India leave Tokyo 2020 with promise of brighter future\n\u2022 North Indian ex-CM likely to be Congress working prez\n\nLatest stories\n\n\u2022 Ex-AAP Goa convenor joins Congress ahead of 2022 polls\n\u2022 Mob attacks lawyer over illegal cattle trade complaint\n\u2022 India showers cash on Olympic hero Neeraj Chopra\n\u2022 Airbus' German jobs at risk without parts unit spinoff\n\u2022 Zuckerberg's cash fuels GOP suspicion, election rules\n\nTrending news\n\n\u2022 Covid outbreak at B'luru apartment block, spread feared\n\u2022 BBMP to strictly enforce 'night curfew' in Bengaluru\n\u2022 Majority of Bengaluru hospitalised patients vaccinated\n\u2022 Food delivery staff raise voice against 'exploitation'\n\u2022 Gopi sir congratulated me, not Saina, says Sindhu\n\nDownload DH APP\n\n\u2022 Services\n\n\u2022 About\n\u2022 Epaper\n\u2022 Archives\n\u2022 Sitemap\n\u2022 Classifieds\n\u2022 Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n\u2022 Printers Mysore\n\u2022 Prajavani\n\u2022 Sudha\n\u2022 Mayura\n\nDownload DH APP\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Terms\n\u2022 Disclaimer\n\u2022 Grievance Redressal\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

Staying on the moon and reaching Mars, however, haven not. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstarts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2\u00a0Blue Origin and Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SpaceX among them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is based on our objectives, the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. The report and Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\n\nIn May, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moon Europa, as NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are notable for not having been on last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original list.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very exciting times. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using our Blue moon lander, which is [a] big one.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics Inc and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Michael Sims, CEO and founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\nMore from Economy\n\nTurkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank sells foreign reserves to stem lira crash\n\nThese are the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most expensive cities\n\nIndia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crypto enthusiasts call New Delhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bluff on ban\n\nA Taliban ban on women in the workforce can cost economy $1bn\n\nMost Read\n\nRussia orders US diplomats to leave as Ukraine tensions escalate\n\nWhy is Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lira crashing and will currency crisis worsen?\n\nEthiopian gov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t says it retook string of towns from Tigray forces\n\nEU chief says bloc must consider mandatory COVID jabs\n\nAbout\n\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Code of Ethics\n\u2022 Terms and Conditions\n\u2022 EU/EEA Regulatory Notice\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookie Policy\n\u2022 Cookie Preferences\n\u2022 Community Guidelines\n\u2022 Work for us\n\u2022 HR Quality\n\nConnect\n\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Apps\n\u2022 Channel Finder\n\u2022 TV Schedule\n\u2022 Podcasts\n\u2022 Submit a Tip\n\nOur Channels\n\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Arabic\n\u2022 Al Jazeera English\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Investigative Unit\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Mubasher\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Documentary\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Balkans\n\u2022 AJ+\n\nOur Network\n\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Media Institute\n\u2022 Learn Arabic\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Forum\n\u2022 Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Al Jazeera Media Network"

Wait, what?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which already held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops getting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become an incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks begin circling*\n\nBack to Taylor! It\u2019s her music, so why can\u2019t she sing it?\n\nIt\u2019s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka original recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the American Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to their original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an artist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in Swift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist financially.\n\nHe said, she said\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The Carlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ... because hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has denied Swift\u2019s claims, saying they were \u201cshocking and false.\u201d And Taylor Swift fans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\nThe bottom line ...\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she\u2019ll be re-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the radio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to Big Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music Group, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to deserve this?\"\n\nWhy Can\u2019t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday highs earlier in the session.\n\nTraders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and China could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to drift and bond prices to go higher.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of tariffs is due to start in mid-December.\n\nOil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut its oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month.\n\nSeparately, Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential oversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent prices lower.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $60.73, down 2.74% on the day.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or 0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66.\n\nHopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year high and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two years, but those gains were pared later in the session.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX lost 0.12% while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight session of gains.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan's Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 0.66%.\n\nLong-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%, down from 1.808% late on Monday.\n\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from 2.293% late on Monday.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075.\n\nWhile the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered expectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus risk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact that the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to satisfy anyone is in question,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Perez said.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.\n\nSpot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.\n\nCopper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,737.00 a tonne.\n\n(Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - here)\n\n(Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - here)\n\n(Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - here)\n\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n\u2022 Apps\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Advertise with Us\n\u2022 Advertising Guidelines\n\u2022 Cookies\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Privacy\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\n\nIt\u2019s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it\u2019s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\n\nWhere it\u2019s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\nFallen Order\u2019s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game\u2019s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era\u2019s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\n\nOne of the narrative\u2019s strongest elements is that it doesn\u2019t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There\u2019s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn't matter to the general story.\n\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez's ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year\u2019s best new character.\n\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction - and my god, every little animation he plays \u2013 both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2\u2019s BT-7274.\n\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn't so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\nThis means you\u2019ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn\u2019t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don\u2019t always need to follow the quest marker if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it\u2019s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It\u2019s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware\u2019s work, which is what makes the map \u2013 available to you at any point \u2013 such a lifesaver.\n\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren\u2019t. They\u2019re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It\u2019s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake\u2019s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn\u2019t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\n\nIn your adventures, you\u2019ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they\u2019re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however - units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they\u2019re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\n\nThe best new character in 2019.\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\nYou\u2019re going to parry the basic trooper\u2019s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You\u2019ll watch for the melee trooper\u2019s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you\u2019ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you\u2019ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you\u2019re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\nFallen Order\u2019s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don\u2019t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you'll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It\u2019s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution.\n\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you\u2019ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it\u2019s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There\u2019s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents\u2019 guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry.\n\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can\u2019t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don\u2019t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They\u2019ll often continue their combo unabated and you\u2019ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren\u2019t working.\n\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn\u2019t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack.\n\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could\u2019ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn\u2019t hook me.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all \u2013 at the game\u2019s worst moments \u2013 lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually - but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren\u2019t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I\u2019ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don\u2019t always win.\n\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting \u2013 but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\n\nAnd yes, it doesn't always get there in this one, but damn If I can\u2019t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It\u2019s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn\u2019t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent - albeit flawed \u2013 combat.\n\nVersion tested: PC.\n\nTagged With\n\n\u2022 Action\n\u2022 Action\n\u2022 Blockbuster\n\u2022 Blockbuster\n\u2022 EA\n\u2022 PC\n\u2022 PlayStation\n\u2022 PS4\n\u2022 Respawn Entertainment\n\u2022 Review\n\u2022 Science Fiction\n\u2022 Single-player\n\u2022 Star Wars\n\u2022 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\n\u2022 star-wars-jedi-fallen-order\n\u2022 Video\n\u2022 Xbox\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSherif Saed\n\nStaff Writer\n\nWhether it's news, reviews, or interviews - Sherif is always eager to tell you about video games.

Tre Harbison rushed for 112 yards on 30 carries for NIU.\n\nThe three previous games between these programs went to overtime.\n\nExtra points\n\nThe status of quarterback Tanner Morgan is uncertain for Minnesota\u2019s game at Northwestern after back-to-back sacks in the last game put the sophomore in the concussion protocol.\n\nCoach P.J. Fleck said Morgan has made progress this week, but the Big Ten\u2019s leading passer has not been cleared. The Gophers (9-1, 6-1) play Saturday against the Wildcats (2-8, 0-7), with a one-game lead in the West Division on Wisconsin.\n\nMorgan could be a game-time decision. If he doesn\u2019t play, either Jacob Clark or Cole Kramer would start. They\u2019re both true freshmen that Fleck would prefer to keep at the four-game limit to preserve their redshirt status.\n\n...

Since Diwali, despite the Supreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the monitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become a standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower surface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the National Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social media about an \u2018oxygen bar\u2019!\n\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about this unique \u2018bar\u2019. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone who is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we have an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and landed up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi\u2019s Saket area that offers this unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is \u2018Oxy Pure\u2019. \u201cAn Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched with an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air pollutants in a cost-effective manner,\u201d the description on the website reads.\n\nOffering \u2018rejuvenating\u2019 experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, \u201cconsists of an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating customers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula along with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you with more vigour and energy.\u201d\n\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and Margarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas and decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299 for fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to visit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right now is 218, which is in \u2018poor\u2019 category.\n\nFor all the Latest Fact Check News, Download News Nation Android and iOS Mobile Apps.\n\nFirst Published : 19 Nov 2019, 09:01:42 AM\n\nRelated Tags:\n\nDelhi Pollution Delhi Smog Oxygen Saket Air Quality\n\nVideos\n\nLakh Take Ki Baat: Baloch anger in Gwadar, see report\n\nLakh Take Ki Baat: Russia-Ukrain dispute will lead to great war!\n\n2022 Ka MahaDangal: BJP's 'Batting' on Hindutva Peach\n\nManjinder Singh Sirsa joins BJP, Akali Dal gets a setback\n\nChunavi Adda: What is the reason for the controversy in Mathura?

Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's third child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10, during which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\nAndrew doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get pizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\nAndrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been with Giuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he had a medical condition in which he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sweat.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, actually? Yes,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he assures himself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sweat at the time.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he explained that he can sweat now.\n\nAndrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if there was any indication of Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crimes during the years in which they were friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was no indication, absolutely no indication,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Andrew said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if there was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFull Stop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those \u00e2\u20ac\u201d time about getting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to look for but I never saw them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\nAs if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the accusations are true, Andrew said he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret his relationship with Epstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In other words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can teach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\nThe interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent guilt in associating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre said before the interview . \"And I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nAndrew hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent denials speak volumes. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope we see more of Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s associates \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from politicians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler \u00e2\u20ac\u201d grilled about their connections with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Andrew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his publicist quitting . After this, Epstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful friends will be more careful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what appears to be guilt.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nRoyals\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nSexual Assault\n\nMedia\n\n\u2022 Share your thoughts with friends.\n\nMore Washington Examiner\n\nQAnon adherents descend on Ghislaine Maxwell trial, upset Trump's name came up in testimony\n\nBarnini Chakraborty\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nQAnon followers rushed to former President Donald Trump's defense after Jeffrey Epstein's longtime pilot named him and several other prominent VIPs as passengers on the \"Lolita Express\" private plane during testimony Tuesday at Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal sex trafficking trial.\n\nAre we going to let the omicron variant become another lockdown excuse?\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nIt's hard to believe the world is fast approaching the two-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic. This has included the initial wave of COVID-19 and more than one variant, including delta, which caused a surge in cases and deaths. It's only natural to wonder if omicron could be the next delta, but early reports are good.\n\nA post-Roe abortion political 'revolution' is unlikely\n\nMichael Barone\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Supreme Court, as this is being written, is hearing oral arguments in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Organization, challenging Mississippi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law banning, with a few exceptions, abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a powerful argument that the court cannot logically uphold this statute, which is less restrictive than most other nations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 abortion laws, without overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that overturned all 50 states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 abortion laws.\n\nIs Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer the new 'Angel of Death'?\n\nChristopher Tremoglie\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nIn August, Vanity Fair published an article labeling Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the \"Angel of Death\" because of increased COVID-19 infections. The narrative was that DeSantis was an incompetent governor whose policies led to an \"unnecessary\" increase in deaths.\n\nJerome Powell helped cause the inflation he now admits is not merely 'transitory'\n\nQuin Hillyer\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom President Joe Biden bizarrely wants to reappoint for another four-year term, made his own incompetence crystal clear on Tuesday by belatedly acknowledging that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rampant inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\u009d after all.\n\nOther Senate Democrats face risks in voting for Build Back Better\n\nMoshe Hill\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \"Build Back Better\" legislation is on the docket for the Senate.\n\nHow the bipartisan Keep Nine initiative aims to protect the Supreme Court\n\nMarc Ang\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe recent discussions about court-packing have given momentum to the bipartisan Keep Nine initiative. Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike have come together to oppose this short-sighted move, garnering support from key groups from even the far Left.\n\nPelosi's Jan. 6 committee lacks integrity\n\nReps. Andy Biggs, Scott Perry, Jody Hice, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Scott DesJarlais, Mary Miller, Clay Higgins, and Andrew Clyde\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe recent revelation that Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jan. 6 committee issued a subpoena based on blatant lies is just one more indication of that mob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illegitimacy. The train of abuses includes stacking the committee with Trump-haters and belligerently biased members of Congress, removing Republicans from the committee who were appointed by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, and issuing a bogus contempt citation of Steve Bannon, who was awaiting a judicial determination on former President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim of executive privilege.\n\nHHS sacrifices freedoms for far-left agenda\n\nMatt Bowman\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Biden administration is at it again. Beginning on Nov. 18, the Department of Health and Human Services revealed a series of reversals of multiple Trump administration policies that protected religious freedom from government mandates.\n\nPentagon misses opportunity with Global Posture Review\n\nSean Durns\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Defense Department announced on Monday that it has concluded its Global Posture Review.

Afterwards, The Tennis Podcast team of Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts gave their initial impressions of the new format.\n\nIs it fair to say that the event was neither as bad as the sceptics thought it would be, nor as good as the organisers hoped it would be? Was it a misjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some Belgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled differently to make sure it is always live? And in what way was an authentic Davis Cup atmosphere created by fans on the smaller stadiums?\n\nMuch of the focus on day one was about the feel and staging of the event, rather than forehands and backhands, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also discussion about Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s straightforward victory against defending champions Croatia, Colombia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valiant effort against Belgium, and Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exciting win over Italy.\n\nThe Tennis Podcast is produced weekly throughout the year, daily during the Grand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP Finals, and the Fed Cup and Davis Cup Finals.\n\n\u2022 This week's Tennis Podcast is sponsored by the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals, which takes place 18-24 November.

Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $6.99-a-month service is stocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Star Wars,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Marvel Studios and classic Disney fare, including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mary Poppins\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bambi.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had forgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being abruptly logged off the service.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me feel good,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mayer, Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patched\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week.\n\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming service\n\n(Walt Disney Co.)\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial, although it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see \u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mayer said.\n\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game.\n\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will see the industry shake out a bit,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mayer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not everyone will succeed.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mayer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mettle. He is viewed as a potential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the design and last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollout of the service.\n\nMayer was named chairman of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct-to-consumer and international division in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and corporate strategy executive at the company.\n\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and BamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological backbone of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s streaming efforts.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in Mayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-on operational role.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mayer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I love what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n----------\n\nCompany TownTelevisionBusinessEntertainment & Arts\n\nMeg James\n\nFollow Us\n\n\u2022 twitter\n\u2022 instagram\n\u2022 email\n\u2022 facebook\n\nMeg James is a corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, covering the business of television and digital disruption in the entertainment industry.

Barnes)\n\nBy Bill Hoppe | Special to the Pioneer Press\n\nPUBLISHED: November 19, 2019 at 8:59 p.m. | UPDATED: November 19, 2019 at 10:16 p.m.\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 Hours before Zach Parise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he always finds a way to start scoring.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It takes a little longer now, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing well now, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting a little bit of confidence back,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Boudreau said before the Wild\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4-1 win over the Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That goes a long way.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is brimming with confidence.\n\nParise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-period goals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relinquish.\n\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third period.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfect,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Boudreau said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mark of a true competitor doing things for the team.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penchant for changing sticks, could see the frustration on his friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used to scoring goals, getting points,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.\n\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can go either way,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Parise said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feed on a two-on-one.\n\nHe tipped Suter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to feel it a little bit again,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Boudreau said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we need those goals.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard not to, though,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Suter acknowledged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153believe in yourselves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and that the Wild are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good team.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve beaten some really good teams this year,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said he said he told them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t playing good.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see him coming,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Eriksson Ek said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He came off my back and, like, I just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nParise said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nEichel said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just trying to spark some energy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period.\n\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talked to the trainers at all,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Boudreau said.\n\nSign up for Newsletters and Alerts\n\nSubscribe\n\nFollow Us\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Instagram\n\u2022 RSS\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\nWith St. Paul rent cap approved, developer hitting brakes on some Highland Bridge projects\n\nWith St. Paul rent cap approved, developer hitting brakes on some Highland Bridge projects\n\nNashville?

Follow us at Twitter @igndeals.\n\nWe bring you the best deals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of random stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is approaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black Friday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\nPS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for 39.99\n\nNintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even on Black Friday).\n\n\u2022 Get it at Walmart for $238.99\n\nKing of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R Curved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming monitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely love it, both for work and for games.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $649.99\n\nNew Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99 (Originally $200)\n\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most people probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $169.99\n\u2022 Also at Walmart\n\nNew Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\n\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped today to the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $139\n\u2022 Also at Walmart\n\n45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift card, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're essentially getting it for $499.\n\n\u2022 Get it at Dell for $549\n\nDell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD for $799.99\n\nUse code \"50OFF699\" This is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\n\n\u2022 Use code \"50OFF699\" to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\nNetgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\nClip the $10 off coupon on the product pageThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $67.77\n\nGet Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\nThis sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane. If you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to uncover your login info one day\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\n\n\u2022 Download Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don't have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\n\n\u2022 Get 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n$10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\n\n\u2022 Get it at Walmart for $249.95\n\nNew Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with Bonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\n\n\u2022 Get it with Free Case at Walmart for $199.96\n\u2022 Get it by itself on Amazon for $199\n\nNew Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon Credit\n\n\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review.If you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version.

This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\n\n\u2022 Get it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n$15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $234.98\n\n30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City 2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\n\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.\n\n\u2022 Get it on Amazon for $243.97\n\nDisney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package and Save $5/Month\n\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription.

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"\u2014and someone he's learned a lot from.\n\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs.\n\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company.\n\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices.\n\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don\u2019t even own a computer anymore and I don\u2019t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\"\n\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff.\n\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader.\n\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said.\n\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented.\n\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\"\n\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\u2022 Smart Phones\n\u2022 Cloud Software\n\u2022 Enterprise Applications\n\nBack to Top\n\nVideo\n\ntrending stories\n\nsponsored resources\n\n\u2022 ABOUT US\n\u2022\n\u2022 Meet the Editors\n\u2022 Send CRN a News Tip\n\u2022 Media Kit\n\u2022 Site Map\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\n\u2022 TOOLS & RESOURCES\n\u2022 CRN Latest Issue\n\u2022 CRN Lists\n\u2022 Annual Report Card\n\u2022 Women of the Channel\n\u2022 Events Calendar\n\u2022 Awards & Plaques\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nCRN Magazines\n\nSign Me Up\n\nUnique industry intelligence, management strategies and forward-looking insight delivered bi-monthly.\n\nCRN Newsletters\n\nSign Me Up\n\nIT channel news with the solution provider perspective you know and trust sent to your inbox.\n\nCRN Lists & Awards\n\nSign Me Up\n\nReceive notification when applications open for lists and awards.\n\nAPPLY\n\nCRN Applications\n\nApply Now\n\nApply Now For 2022 CRN Managed Service Providers\n\nApply Now\n\nTake the 2021 CRN Salary Survey\n\nCareers\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nShare, Like, Follow CRN\n\n\u00a9 The Channel Company\nAll rights reserved."

One of Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\n\nThe Chinese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a Asian financial hub.\n\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual governance structure.\n\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.\n\nRead more: Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weigh\n\nHong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\n\nAlibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.\n\nMain image credit: Getty\n\nShare this article\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Similarly tagged content:\n\nSections\n\n\u2022 Markets & Economics\n\nCategories\n\n\u2022 Markets\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\u2022 Alibaba\n\nTrending Articles\n\nHow to build the best digital marketing team\n\nEditorial: Slashing staff pay for remote work is a slap-dash response to the shifts of the pandemic\n\nCity Moves: Who\u2019s switching jobs in the Square Mile this week?\n\nHow accountancy can take the lead when it comes to inclusive workplaces\n\nMore from City A.M.\n\nAlibaba IPO: E-commerce giant\u2019s shares jump on blockbuster Hong Kong debut\n\nAlibaba's shares jump on its blockbuster Hong Kong debut\n\nAlibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\nAlibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secondary Hong Kong listing gets exchange approval\n\nSoftbank earns $11bn for selling some of its huge Alibaba stake\n\nJack Ma\u2019s Alibaba chases \u2018$20bn Hong Kong float\u2019\n\nUber IPO: Ride-hailing firm seeks to sell $10bn of shares in largest tech float since Alibaba\n\nChina\u2019s success among western firms will depend on the desirability of the brand\n\nE-commerce giant Alibaba invests \u00c2\u00a32.97bn in Suning as global mergers and acquisitions hit new high\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to the City A.M. newsletter to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\tBy signing up to our newsletters you agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n\n\u2022 About us\n\u2022 Advertising\n\u2022 Contact\n\u2022 Terms & Conditions\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Markets & Economics\n\u2022 Opinion\n\u2022 Jobs and Money\n\u2022 Unwind\n\u2022 Crypto A.M.\n\u2022 The Punter\n\n\u2022 COP 26\n\u2022 Awards 2019\n\nFollow us for breaking news and latest updates\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Latest paper\n\u2022 Advertising\n\u2022 CryptoAM.io\n\u2022 Awards\n\u2022 About\n\u2022 Tickets\n\nCopyright 2021 City A.M.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\u00c2\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the largest international carrier in the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\nMore In Dubai Airshow\n\nThe rich are getting richer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fueling a private jet boom\n\nNatasha Turak\n\nAirbus smashes orders at Dubai Air Show, Boeing trails behind despite big 737 Max sale\n\nNatasha Turak\n\n'The freighter markets are on fire right now.

The protests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation that would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland.

(Image credit: NASA/ESA/K. Retherford/SWRI)\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third \u2014 liquid water \u2014 is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\nRelated: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images\n\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life.\n\nThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights \u2014 April 26, 2016 \u2014 they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff \u2014 about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).\n\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.\n\nNASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years \u2014 or if they just get really lucky.\n\n\u2022 NASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life\n\u2022 Photos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter\n\u2022 Keck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea\n\nMike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), is out now.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies.\n\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experiencing today.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nMr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.\n\nThe president says his approach has created leverage \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and in some cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table.\n\nBusiness & Economy: Latest Updates\n\nUpdated\u00c2\n\nDec. 1, 2021, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\n\u2022 Capital One is the latest bank to say it will eliminate overdraft fees.\n\u2022 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a fast but uneven recovery, the O.E.C.D. reports.\n\u2022 Tesla is helping Chinese companies become global players in the electric car industry.\n\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.\n\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team\u00e2\u20ac\u009d had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.\n\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States \u00e2\u20ac\u0153farm country,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpredictable behavior \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\nImage\n\nPresident Trump met with North Korean President Kim Jong-un in Hanoi in February.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.\n\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit well with the world of global supply chains. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nEven Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the show to end.\n\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardship\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153time is running out for many in agriculture.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested \u00e2\u20ac\u201d larger purchases \u00e2\u20ac\u0153than any time in our history, by far\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\nMr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached.\n\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\n\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nSite Information Navigation\n\n\u2022 \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a02021\u00c2\u00a0The New York Times Company\n\n\u2022 NYTCo\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Accessibility\n\u2022 Work with us\n\u2022 Advertise\n\u2022 T Brand Studio\n\u2022 Your Ad Choices\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Terms of Service\n\u2022 Terms of Sale\n\u2022 Site Map\n\u2022 Canada\n\u2022 International\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 Subscriptions"

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Star Trek and 2013\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film.\n\n\"This will be Hawley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second film\"\n\nThe fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 schedules shift. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether Hawley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return \u00e2\u20ac\u201d both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Wrap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention Hemsworth.\n\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\nThe fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nNo release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced.\n\nNext Up In Tech\n\nSign up for the newsletter Verge Deals\n\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\n\nJust one more thing!\n\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\n\nEmail (required)\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Notice and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLoading comments...\n\nChorus\n\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Privacy Notice\n\u2022 Cookie Policy\n\u2022 Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n\u2022 Licensing FAQ\n\u2022 Accessibility\n\u2022 Platform Status\n\n\u2022 Contact\n\u2022 Tip Us\n\u2022 Community Guidelines\n\u2022 About\n\u2022 Ethics Statement\n\nVox Media Vox Media logo.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer considers settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but the Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\n\nHighlights\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.\n\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement.\n\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel.\n\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body.\n\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added.\n\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\u00c2\n\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\".\n\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will stand tall.\"\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\n\nTags:USIsraelPalestineEuDonald TrumpJewish stateIsraeli settlements\n\nVia SyndiGate.info\n\nCopyright @ 2021 The New Arab.\n\nYou may also like\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up to get Al Bawaba's exclusive celeb scoops and entertainment news\n\n\u2022 Latest\n\u2022 Popular\n\nChelsea Open to Selling Ziyech & Werner in January\n\nRussia Calls US Embassy Staff to Leave Country by End of January\n\nUN Chief: UNRWA is Still Facing Funding Crisis\n\nNigeria Reports First Omicron Variant Cases\n\nAnti-Military Coup Protesters Continue Rallying in Sudan\n\nLoading content ...\n\nFooter menu\n\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Advertise With Us\n\u2022 Become a Subscriber\n\u2022 Our Team\n\u2022 Solve a Technical Question\n\u2022 Complaints and Suggestions\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 RSS Feeds\n\nSocial media links\n\n\u2022 FB\n\u2022 Linkedin\n\u2022 Twitter\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n\nSubscribe\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2000 - 2021 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com)"

Gaspard succeeds Greg Foster, who will retire December 31, 2017. Foster will join the Experience Board of Advisors.\n\nJunior Gaspard joined Experience in March of 2013 as Vice President of Sales for Franchise and Collegiate sports, and was instrumental in forming Experience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early relationships with strategic ticketing and channel partnerships. He also led the efforts to build the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 350 relationships with professional and collegiate sports and\nentertainment partners including those from the MLB, NBA, NCAA, NFL, NHL and Live Nation.\n\nIn 2015, Gaspard was promoted to Senior Vice President of Sales, Product and Marketing, including all business-to-business and business-to-consumer functions. He was again promoted to Chief Revenue Officer in June of 2016, with his role expanding to include all revenue opportunities for the company.\n\nAlex Taylor, Cox Enterprises\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Chief Operating Officer and Chairman of the Experience Board of Advisors, noted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Junior was employee number eight for Experience and has a deep understanding of the company as well as the sports and entertainment industry.

Soon thereafter, the company launched a groundbreaking consumer offering, INWEGO\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, a subscription service that provides tickets to unlimited sports and live events for one monthly fee. INWEGO is live today in Atlanta and Phoenix, offering members tickets to pro sports, concerts, college sports, festivals, comedy shows and more, all included in the monthly subscription. More cities are planned for 2018.\n\nIncoming Experience President and CEO Junior Gaspard noted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continuing the tradition of excellence that Experience has brought to the industry is my deep honor. The company is filled with amazing people, a dynamic culture, and we have dedicated, innovative partners, making it a pleasure to come to work each and every day.

The key to Stadia\u2019s success, says Buser, is Google\u2019s built-in infrastructure. \u201cWe have one of the largest private networks in the world,\u201d he says, boasting that Google\u2019s servers can \u201cdeliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\u201d The goal is to deliver a \u201cseamless experience\u201d that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\n\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin\u2019s Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works\u2019 Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia\u2019s lineup as its \u201cAchilles heel.\u201d While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\n\u201cThey need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\u201d says Ward. \u201cGoogle\u2019s planned \u2018free\u2019 base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community\u2026and that should seed interest in the Founder\u2019s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there\u2019s a lot of other gaming options out there.\u201d\n\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google\u2019s platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \u201cGoogle offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\u201d says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \u201cThey help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don\u2019t own a console or PC join in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to be where the consumer is,\u201d Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \u201cGenerally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We\u2019re excited by the opportunity and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\n\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \u201c2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\u201d Ward says. \u201cI think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cStreaming is somewhat binary,\u201d says Early. \u201cYou are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you\u2019re not.\u201d In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \u201cbelievers\u201d in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\n\u201cThe groundwork is there,\u201d Buser says. \u201cIn terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It\u2019s just staggering.\u201d\n\nWhile Stadia\u2019s current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \u201cOur objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the interesting question is if we\u2019re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that\u2019s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we\u2019d look at.\u201d\n\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple\u2019s offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\n\n\u201cI think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\u201d says Ward.\n\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \u201cThis is where you\u2019ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll never download a game or have to download an update. We\u2019re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven\u2019t seen it in games yet. It\u2019s tough to go back to console.\u201d\n\nRead More About:\n\n\u2022 Google\n\u2022 Video Games\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe\tSign Up\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nStreaming Wars\n\nStreaming Services to See 150M Cancellations Next Year as Churn Heats Up, Deloitte Predicts\n\nViacomCBS\n\nViacomCBS Releases 2021 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report\n\ninternational\n\nVirus Deja Vu?

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new Gannett,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.\n\nSince 2008, there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole.\n\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack.\n\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much care for.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since 2008, there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produced a strategy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153synergies\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immaterial\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\nColumn: A vulture firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for Gannett shows there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still value in newspapers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for plundering\n\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially local journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hands out of the public cookie jar \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Alden Global Capital is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vulture investing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d firm that makes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)\n\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t escape the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic challenges.\n\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news assets.\n\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nMcClatchy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shareholder.\n\nBusiness\n\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n\nThe owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some shareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\n\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stable of smaller metro newspapers.\n\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune. Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the news audience has been moving to.\n\nGateHouse hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consolidate copy editing and page design\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Abernathy reported.\n\nReed, who will be the merged company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d It shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t escape notice that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investing for growth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBusiness\n\nColumn: Freelancers fear California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n\nFreelance writers and photographers fear California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new gig worker law will make them unemployable.\n\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morally wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy to get rid of Fortress,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Cooperman told Reed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even take the money, given what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done here.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)\n\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Doctor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They see the way down as close to inevitable.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn the news business that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery \u00e2\u20ac\u201d McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and at an ever faster pace \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153After two more years of this,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Doctor asks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n----------\n\nBusiness\n\nMichael Hiltzik\n\nFollow Us\n\n\u2022 twitter\n\u2022 instagram\n\u2022 email\n\u2022 facebook\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik writes a daily blog appearing on latimes.com.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend it.

You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sister\u00e2\u20ac\u009d didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Some bugs are noticeable at once at testing, and some can be notice only at the certain combination of actions. Most of bugs found by\u00c2\u00a0you during the game. And, thanks to your reports about them, I can quickly fix it.\n\nSo, if you notice that some game mechanics are working incorrectly, or some event used to work before, and now you cannot start it, or even you\u00c2\u00a0just cannot press some button, spend a minute of time and write about it in the bug-tracker. In such way you can help make my games better.\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Email\n\u2022 Pinterest\n\u2022 LinkedIn\n\u2022 Odnoklassniki\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 VKontakte\n\u2022 Telegram\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Email\n\u2022 Pinterest\n\u2022 LinkedIn\n\u2022 Odnoklassniki\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 VKontakte\n\u2022 Telegram\n\nPrevious Post\n\nNext Post\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nClose\n\nOptions\n\nPolls\n\nHave you already played Dare to Play 3?

Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it - Meth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Noem tweeted Monday night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoem later\u00c2\u00a0tweeted that the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meth epidemic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to be a dinner table conversation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we need everyone on it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe campaign, which includes both digital and TV ads, cost the state roughly $449,000, according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n\nOne campaign video featured a series of\u00c2\u00a0South Dakotans\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00c2\u00a0including both adults and children\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d declaring, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on meth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The video, as well as photos of people with the tagline, prompted some Twitter users to argue that the\u00c2\u00a0promotional material made it look as\u00c2\u00a0if those featured in the campaign were on the drug themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153South Dakota: if we were any higher, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be North Dakota,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d one user quipped.\n\nAnother wondered why the state bothered to trademark the tagline in the first place.\n\nI love that they trademarked it.

Ford\n\nI wanted to learn why a beloved science fiction writer fell into obscurity after his death. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that I would help bring his books back to life.\n\nBy Isaac Butler\n\nNov 15, 20195:45 AM\n\nJohn M. Ford in 1987. Photo illustration by Slate.

Wade Case (Apart From the Timing)\n\u2022 A Thrillingly Fresh Take on Noir From Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n\u2022 Did the War on Terror Create Trump?\n\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anyone publishing his books?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?\n\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was brilliant from the start\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out of the water in every novel,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too hard for people because he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spell things out.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d respond, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a horror of being obvious.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s characters often do. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one unifying theme to his books, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\u2019ve been George R.R. Martin.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Neil Gaiman\n\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The ephemera of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask Dr. Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World, the first book in Robert Jordan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Winter Solstice, Camelot Station,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He would make art in the most surprising places,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Gaiman told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Life was not long enough,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she recalled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He could have had a more successful career,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband and Tor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editor in chief, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if he had been more disciplined about his writing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and stuck to one genre, or written a series. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been George R.R. Martin.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels (The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet?, both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been marketed like The Name of the Rose. You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u009d Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly do Umberto Eco\u00e2\u20ac\u201clevel business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002. Photo by David Dyer-Bennet\n\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the extent that Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153games consultant\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blood brother,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d had essentially adopted him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\n\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Matthesen recalled in an email. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The thing with Elise bothered\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family, Starner said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d But either way, at some point, Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now-deceased father told Starner that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the only way I know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d When he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d finish chunks of it, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.\n\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.\n\nIf he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\n\nIf he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He looked a little surprised,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she wrote in an email. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153married,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion, and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished\u00c2\u00a0Aspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister, Martha Fry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll contact between Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\n\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153introverted by nature.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Dale wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Martha added that shortly before their father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kind and loving.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Elise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Dale wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body and calling the police. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriend,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial affairs.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear back, they assumed there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requests?\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, his agent Valerie Smith \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was beginning the process of essentially vanishing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from the industry. She \u00e2\u20ac\u0153became more and more intermittent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978.\u00c2\u00a0Web of Angels\u00c2\u00a0was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty overwhelmed,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said.\u00c2\u00a0Her heartbreak over Mike Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I reconnected Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat long last\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs in one of John M. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\n\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have words, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such good news,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she replied in an email. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Except maybe Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to die. Tell me a story.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No. You tell me one, and when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gone, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell it to somebody else.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novel\u00c2\u00a0Web of Angels.

Shortly after, some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\n\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence.\u00c2\u00a0 Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune.\u00c2\n\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\u00c2\n\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\n\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates.\u00c2\n\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates.\u00c2\n\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure.\u00c2\n\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\n\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony.\u00c2\n\n\u2022 Dan Evon\n\n\u2022 Published\t18 November 2019\n\nSources\n\nFlaherty, Anne. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u01535 Key Takeaways From Testimony by Former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 ABC News. \u00c2\u00a0 15 November 2019.\n\nMcCarthy, Tom; Smith, David. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ukraine Ambassador Describes Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcShocking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Smear Campaign Against Her.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 The Guardian. \u00c2\u00a0 15 November 2019.\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\nNo, the Rittenhouses Haven\u2019t Sued Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg for Defamation\n\nNo, the Rittenhouses Haven\u2019t Sued Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg for Defamation\n\nFarmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Almanac Predicts \u2018Season of Shivers\u2019\n\nFarmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Almanac Predicts \u2018Season of Shivers\u2019\n\nWere This Fawn and Bobcat Found Huddled Together After a California Wildfire?\n\nWere This Fawn and Bobcat Found Huddled Together After a California Wildfire?\n\nDid an Obese Man Survive Without Eating for 382 Days?\n\nDid an Obese Man Survive Without Eating for 382 Days?\n\nShould an Empty Toilet Paper Roll or Red Cup Be Placed Under the Toilet Seat at Night?\n\nShould an Empty Toilet Paper Roll or Red Cup Be Placed Under the Toilet Seat at Night?\n\nView all\n\nMost Searched\n\nDid Joe Biden Call Kyle Rittenhouse a \u2018White Supremacist\u2019?\n\nDid Joe Biden Call Kyle Rittenhouse a \u2018White Supremacist\u2019?\n\nA Guide To Viral Rumors in the Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal\n\nA Guide To Viral Rumors in the Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal\n\nDid Rittenhouse\u2019s Grandparents Own Gas Station in Kenosha?\n\nDid Rittenhouse\u2019s Grandparents Own Gas Station in Kenosha?\n\nDid 45K People Die Within 3 Days of Getting COVID Vaccine?\n\nDid 45K People Die Within 3 Days of Getting COVID Vaccine?\n\nDoes Facebook Prohibit Posting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer?\n\nDoes Facebook Prohibit Posting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer?\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\tFAQs\tContact Us\tSubmit a Topic\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\tSearch\tArchive\tShop\n\nSections\n\nLatest\tTop\tFact Checks\tNews\n\nAccount\n\nLogin\tMy Account\tLog Out\n\nLike Us on Facebook\tFollow Us on Twitter\tContact Us\tUse our RSS Feed\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 1995 - 2021 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\n\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\n\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\nTerms of Use\tPrivacy Policy\tCookie Policy\tDon't Sell My Info\tConsent Preferences\n\nclose\u00c3\u2014\n\nMain Menu\n\nClose Main Menu\n\nBecome a Member\tWhat's New\tFact Checks\tNews\tAbout Us\tContact Us\tMy Account\tLog In\tLog Out\n\nSearch\n\nSearch Snopes"

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.\n\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.\n\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nClose\n\nRelated stories\n\nTaking Stock | Market cheers GDP numbers; Sensex up 619 points, Nifty above 17,100\n\nNifty closes above 17,100, Sensex gains over 600 points | 5 factors supporting the market\n\nClosing Bell: Nifty closes above 17,100, Sensex gains 620 pts led by metal, financials; pharma drags\n\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\n\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\n\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\n\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.\n\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\n\nNear-term consolidation likely\n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"\n\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\n\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\nThe Indian market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages \u00e2\u20ac\u0153give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We pray for the full recovery of both men,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pave the way\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are profoundly pleased and relieved\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at the hostages\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 release, adding that Weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Flipboard\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 Email\n\u2022 Copy\tFiled under\n\n\u2022 afghanistan\n\u2022 hostages\n\u2022 middle east\n\u2022 prisoners\n\u2022 taliban\n\u2022 11/19/19\n\nRead Next\tTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nTrending Now\ton NYPost.com\n\nThis story has been shared 251,276 times.\t251,276\n\n'Concerning' asteroid will break into Earth's orbit in a week: NASA\n\nThis story has been shared 172,495 times.\t172,495\n\nThree teens killed by Michigan high school shooter identified\n\nThis story has been shared 64,011 times.\t64,011\n\nMillions shocked over secret Alexa code that unlocks hidden Super Mode\n\nwhat to shop now\n\nThe 12 best weighted blankets of 2021 and where to buy them\n\nThe best wedding registry items, per The Knot, Zola and a wedding planner\n\nViral 'scrunched booty' Amazon leggings are back, on sale for up to 30% off\n\nHere's how to use your remaining FSA dollars before the 2021 deadline\n\nThe 8 best places to buy Christmas and holiday cards online in 2021\n\nwhat to shop now\n\nThe 12 best weighted blankets of 2021 and where to buy them\n\nThe best wedding registry items, per The Knot, Zola and a wedding planner\n\nViral 'scrunched booty' Amazon leggings are back, on sale for up to 30% off\n\nHere's how to use your remaining FSA dollars before the 2021 deadline\n\nThe 8 best places to buy Christmas and holiday cards online in 2021\n\nNow on\tPage Six\n\nMeadow Walker honors father Paul Walker on 8th anniversary of his death\n\nSimone Biles bares her butt on the beach and more star snaps\n\nHeather Dubrow calls former \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRHOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 star Kelly Dodd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpathetic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over attacks\n\nSee All\n\nVideo\n\n4-year-old amputee hikes 3,560-foot mountain\n\nNow on\tDecider\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe View\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hosts Tackle Chris Cuomo CNN Scandal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Massive Ethical Breach\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abuse Of Power\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSee All\n\nShare This Article\n\nShare Selection\n\n\u2022 Share selection to Facebook\n\u2022 Share selection to Twitter\n\nMore Stories\n\nPage Six\n\nThirsty Salma Hayek puts on a busty display and more star snaps\n\nNYPost\n\n'Concerning' asteroid will break into Earth's orbit in a week: NASA\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Instagram\n\u2022 LinkedIn\n\u2022 Email\n\u2022 YouTube\n\n\u2022 Sections & Features\n\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Metro\n\u2022 Sports\n\u2022 Business\n\u2022 Opinion\n\u2022 Entertainment\n\u2022 Fashion\n\u2022 Shopping\n\u2022 Living\n\u2022 Media\n\u2022 Tech\n\u2022 Real Estate\n\u2022 Video\n\u2022 Photos\n\u2022 Visual Stories\n\u2022 Alexa\n\u2022 Covers\n\u2022 Horoscopes\n\u2022 Sports Odds\n\u2022 Podcasts\n\u2022 Columnists\n\u2022 Classifieds\n\n\u2022 Post Sports+\n\n\u2022 Subscribe\n\u2022 Articles\n\u2022 Manage\n\n\u2022 Newsletters & Feeds\n\n\u2022 Email Newsletters\n\u2022 RSS Feeds\n\u2022 NY Post Official Store\n\u2022 Home Delivery\n\n\u2022 Subscribe\n\u2022 Manage Subscription\n\n\u2022 Delivery Help\n\n\u2022 Help/Support\n\n\u2022 About New York Post\n\u2022 Customer Service\n\u2022 App FAQ & Help\n\u2022 Community Guidelines\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\n\u2022 Tips\n\u2022 Newsroom\n\u2022 Letters to the Editor\n\u2022 Reprints\n\u2022 Careers\n\n\u2022 Apps\n\n\u2022 iPhone App\n\u2022 iPad App\n\u2022 Android Phone\n\u2022 Android Tablet\n\u2022 Advertise\n\n\u2022 Media Kit\n\u2022 Contact\n\n\u00a9 2021 NYP Holdings, Inc.

However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, in the words of the Corrs, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.\n\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.\n\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2030min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAt first glance, the man didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a smoker. His workplace didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nCDC: Salmonella Outbreak Has Left 279 Ill, 26 Hospitalized In 29 States\n\nCanadians End Up In ICU After Attending \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCovid Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n\nWhite House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public\n\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acquired\u00e2\u20ac\u009d both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.\n\nBreathing tests demonstrated that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\nA CT of his chest revealed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ground glass\u00e2\u20ac\u009d pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\n\"Pigeon breeder's lung\" is a variation of hypersensitivity penumonitis. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feather duvet lung.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bird fancier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pigeon breeder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\nWait there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153farmer's lung,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d not to be confused with a farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Humidifier lung\u00e2\u20ac\u009d may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot tub lung,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not always good if what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids \u00e2\u20ac\u0153had a transformative effect within 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nEventually, everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c98%\u00e2\u20ac\u2030which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not someone whom you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pigeons that you are breeding by the dozens in your kitchen.\n\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feather duvet lung\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are still relatively uncommon. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where after even the slightest touch, you feel weak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\n\nSummary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\n\u2022 Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\n\u2022 Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\n\u2022 Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work going forward. (More)\n\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\nA key part of GiveWell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [an] incubator \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\n\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling \u2026 promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\nModeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant\u2019s cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\n\u2022 if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\n\u2022 if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities\u2019 funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities\u2019 funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn\u2019t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\n\nRisks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\n\u2022 Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell\u2019s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\n\u2022 We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\nGoing forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\nPosted in GiveWell Incubation Grants | Permalink | 1 Comment\n\n\u2022 Previous Post\n\u2022 Next Post\n\nComments\n\nJamie Cassidy on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said:\n\nI am so pumped about this!

A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\nRelated: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n\u2022 27 Oddest Medical Case Reports\n\u2022 10 Strangest Medical Cases\n\u2022 11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nWant more science?

By \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tasting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the presence of certain pathogens, these cells may act as sentinels for the immune system.\n\nRenderBurger for Quanta Magazine\n\nCarrie Arnold\n\nContributing Writer\n\n----------\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\n----------\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunologyAll topics\n\nWhen the immunologist De\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Broski Herbert at the University of Pennsylvania looked deep inside the lungs of mice infected with influenza, he thought he was seeing things. He had found a strange-looking cell with a distinctive thatch of projections like dreadlocks atop a pear-shaped body, and it was studded with taste receptors. He recalled that it looked just like a tuft cell \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a cell type most often associated with the lining of the intestines.\n\nBut what would a cell covered with taste receptors be doing in the lungs? And why did it only appear there in response to a severe bout of influenza?\n\nHerbert wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone in his puzzlement over this mysterious and little-studied group of cells that keep turning up in unexpected places, from the thymus (a small gland in the chest where pathogen-fighting T cells mature) to the pancreas. Scientists are only just beginning to understand them, but it is gradually becoming clear that tuft cells are an important hub for the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenses precisely because they can communicate with the immune system and other sets of tissues, and because their taste receptors allow them to identify threats that are still invisible to other immune cells.\n\nResearchers around the world are tracing the ancient evolutionary roots that olfactory and taste receptors (collectively called chemosensory receptors or nutrient receptors) share with the immune system. A flurry of work in recent years shows that their paths cross far more often than anyone anticipated, and that this chemosensory-immunological network plays a role not just in infection, but in cancer and at least a handful of other diseases.\n\nThis system, says Richard Locksley, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, helps direct a systematic response to potential dangers throughout the body. Research focusing on the interactions of the tuft cell could offer a glimpse of how organ systems work together. He describes the prospects of what could come from the studies of these receptors and cells as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exciting,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but cautions that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in the very early days\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of figuring it out.\n\nNot Merely Taste and Smell Receptors\n\nOne of life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamental challenges is to find food that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to eat and avoid food that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Outside of our modern world of prepackaged food on grocery store shelves, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a perilous task. Taking advantage of a new type of food could mean the difference between starvation and survival, or it could mean an early death from accidental self-poisoning. Chemosensory receptors help us make this distinction. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so essential that even single-celled bacteria such as Escherichia coli carry a type of this receptor.\n\nDespite the near universality of these receptors and their centrality to survival, scientists didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discover the big family of genes that encode for olfactory receptors until 1991, with the ones for taste receptors following in 2000. (The olfactory receptor discovery brought the researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck a Nobel Prize in 2004.) Olfactory receptors and taste receptors for bitter, sweet and umami (savory) are all part of a large family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are embedded in cell membranes. Although the precise details vary from receptor to receptor, when a GPCR binds to the proper molecule, it sets off a signaling cascade within the cell. For taste and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, this cascade causes neurons to fire and enables us to recognize everything from the rich sweetness of a chocolate chip cookie to the nose-wrinkling stench of a passing skunk.\n\nThe discoveries of these receptors were momentous, groundbreaking advances, says Jennifer Pluznick, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But in her view, labeling them as olfactory and taste receptors rather than as chemosensory receptors entrenched the idea that they function specifically and exclusively in smell and taste. If scientists found signs of these receptors in cells outside the nose and mouth, it was easy to write them off as mistakes or anomalies. She herself was shocked to find an olfactory receptor called Olfr78 in kidney cells, a finding that she reported in 2009.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\n----------\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nSubscribe now\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nVideo: In this talk presented at the 2016 TEDMED conference, Jennifer Pluznick, an associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the diverse function of the scent detectors found in tissues throughout the body.\n\nTEDMED\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know that I can trust this data, you know?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Pluznick recalled. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\n\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions.\n\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections.\n\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Pluznick said.\n\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove\u00c2\u00a0home the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taste\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smell\u00e2\u20ac\u009d minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenses.\n\nA Job for Tuft Cells\n\nIn researchers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contributing to our sense of taste.\n\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 function, and he eventually got his answer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\n\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\n\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201d specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\n\nHowitt realized that T. muris wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking for protozoa,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Howitt said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were focused on bacteria.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\n\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\n\nHowitt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\n\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that\u00c2\u00a0finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said.\n\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature, respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\n\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people just kind of ignored them or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even realize that they were there,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Megan Baldridge, a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\n\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\n\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection, newly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears at right). Tuft cells don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to emerge as part of the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response against the infection.\n\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sure enough, they were all over the place,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Vaughan said. But the tuft cells only appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he and Herbert were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basically seeing a cell type where [it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] not supposed to be.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Although he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens after the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune response.\n\nThe researchers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or what they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taste\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for the body to respond to even minute threats.\n\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products present in microenvironments within the body. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once some of those metabolic products go out of whack \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a response if something is wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous systems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose tools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all evolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taste\u00e2\u20ac\u009d receptors on the tongue first, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the order in which it evolved.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 immune functions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as monocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to detect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed that rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts suggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent receptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of other groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\n\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these receptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them for any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft cells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the invaders before they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the sudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not always present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and asthma: There could be dangers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you have too many of these cells and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too poised to respond to the external environment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nCorrection added Nov. 18, 2019: The caption\u00c2\u00a0below the photograph of Herbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to observe the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice.\n\nThis article was reprinted on\u00c2\u00a0Wired.com.\n\nCarrie Arnold\n\nContributing Writer\n\n----------\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\n----------\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunologyAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\n----------\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nSubscribe now\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nComment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to\u00c2\u00a0facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\n\nThe Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police.\n\nNow Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail.\n\nFrom behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US.\n\nWhat was the Swedish investigation about?\n\nAssange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\n\nHe also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation.\n\nWikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.\"\n\nWhat charges does Assange face in the US?\n\nAustralian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US.\n\nHe is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a lengthy prison term.\n\n\u2022 How likely is an Assange conviction in US?\n\nIn June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US.\n\nImage source, Reuters\n\nImage caption,\n\nAssange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London\n\nAssange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term.\n\nBut a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition hearing because of his \"history of absconding\".\n\nLast month, a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\u2022 Sweden\n\u2022 Julian Assange\n\u2022 Wikileaks\n\u2022 United States\n\nMore on this story\n\nAssange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy\n\nPublished\n11 April 2019\n\nWikileaks founder visited by Pamela Anderson\n\nPublished\n7 May 2019\n\nAssange 'doesn't consent' to US extradition\n\nPublished\n2 May 2019\n\nProfile: Julian Assange\n\nPublished\n23 September 2020\n\nThe Julian Assange story\n\nPublished\n12 April 2019\n\nTop Stories\n\nLive.\u00c2\n\nTime to consider mandatory jabs - EU chief\n\nEU launches \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn global bid to challenge China\n\nPublished\n1 hour ago\n\nPolice to search arms supplier over Rust shooting\n\nPublished\n22 minutes ago\n\nFeatures\n\nWhy abortion rights in US could be about to change\n\nInside the city at the heart of Yemen's dirty war\n\n'The place I grew up in will not survive' Video'The place I grew up in will not survive'\n\nThe HIV beliefs costing jobs, health and relationships\n\nThe woman who became Sweden's first female PM - twice\n\nWhy Gambians won't stop voting with marbles\n\nKashmiri skier taking India to Beijing Olympics\n\nAre we thinking about alien life all wrong?\n\nBBC Worklife: The benefits of constant job-hunting\n\nElsewhere on the BBC\n\nThe story of an intense secret affair\n\nAre Marianne and Connell meant to be together?\n\nAn insight into the life of Paul McCartney\n\nThe man himself on ten key lyrics, including some of The Beatles' classics\n\nMost Read\n\n1WW2 bomb blows up in Munich, wounding four\n\n2World's most expensive city to live in revealed\n\n3US author apologises to man cleared of her rape\n\n4Apple and Spotify reveal 2021's most-streamed songs\n\n5Arsenal star fends off baseball bat-wielding robber\n\n6EU launches \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn global bid to challenge China\n\n7Epstein pilot testifies that he flew Prince Andrew\n\n8Why abortion rights in US could be about to change\n\n9CNN star anchor suspended over help to his brother\n\n10Student fatally shoots three in Michigan school\n\nBBC News Services\n\n\u2022 On your mobile\n\u2022 On smart speakers\n\u2022 Get news alerts\n\u2022 Contact BBC News\n\n\u2022 Home\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Sport\n\u2022 Reel\n\u2022 Worklife\n\u2022 Travel\n\u2022 Future\n\u2022 Culture\n\u2022 Music\n\u2022 TV\n\u2022 Weather\n\u2022 Sounds\n\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 About the BBC\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Cookies\n\u2022 Accessibility Help\n\u2022 Parental Guidance\n\u2022 Contact the BBC\n\u2022 Get Personalised Newsletters\n\u2022 Why you can trust the BBC\n\u2022 Advertise with us\n\u2022 AdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 BBC.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not intended to see it,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You might need to have a message that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Graham said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWow this is a little over the edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or they might think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy are they putting it here?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant for a specific population.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where a lot of young men were spending more time,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Graham said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It can seem like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought South Dakota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign \u00e2\u20ac\u201c run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was meant to raise eyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings and other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153OK, great, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be provocative, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sanborn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America talking about? South Dakota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a meth problem, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we want to try to help,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sanborn said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sanborn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nLocal journalism is essential.\n\nGive directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,\u201d Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. \u201cInstead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.\u201d\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they\u2019re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren\u2019t the only ones who should stand trial \u2013 every one of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nEpstein accusers pour out their anger in court\n\nOne by one, more than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood before a judge and poured out their anger toward the financier Tuesday, taking advantage of an extraordinary opportunity to be heard in court after Epstein's jailhouse suicide. (Aug. 27)\n\nAP, AP\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n\nInternal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\n\nInvestigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters\u2019 questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. \u201cIt is our hope that we\u2019ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,\u201d said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would \u201cruin his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had hoped that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,\u201d Figgins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they\u2019re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they\u2019re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?\u201d\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. \u201cWhen all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you\u2019ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.\u201d\n\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public\u2019s trust in us.\u201d\n\nEpstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n\u201cWhen removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n\u201cForty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.\u201d\n\nContributing: Kristine Phillips\n\nEpstein accusers: Empowering, upsetting to testify\n\nMore than a dozen women spoke out in a courtroom Tuesday about the sexual abuse they say they've suffered at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. The emotional testimony came weeks after the 66-year-old killed himself in a New York jail cell.

        "texto":"The core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\n\nSeeking a bigger role for a big rocket\n\nby Jeff Foust\nMonday, November 18, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket\u2019s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a \u201cGreen Run\u201d test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\n\u201cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,\u201d Cooke said.\n\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA\u2019s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn\u2019t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration\u2019s own party in Congress. \u201cEvery space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee\u2019s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA\u2019s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA\u2019s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\n\u201cWhile I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA\u2019s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA\u2019s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. \u201cThe fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,\u201d said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke\u2019s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a big booster, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\n\u201cSLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.\u201d He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit\u2014no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\n\u201cThe mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,\u201d Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke\u2019s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. \u201cI cannot disagree with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with eight launches, I\u2019ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a big booster, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don\u2019t have it, you\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn\u2019t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called \u201cexperiments\u201d in procurement. \u201cManaging and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,\u201d he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\n\u201cA management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.\u201d\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. \u201cThe plate is really full today,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.\u201d\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA\u2019s plate is the Gateway. \u201cI do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,\u201d he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. \u201cThere\u2019s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.\u201d\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. \u201cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\u2014I\u2019m not confident that could happen.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA\u2019s use\u2014or unwillingness to use\u2014the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\n\u201cI understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,\u201d he said, including the first Block 1B. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,\u201d responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn\u2019t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we\u2019re guaranteed the second core we\u2019d need for a Moon landing in 2024,\u201d added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. \u201cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\u2014I\u2019m not confident that could happen.\u201d\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. \u201cWhat commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?\u201d\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman\u2019s OmegA.\n\n\u201cThere could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,\u201d Bridenstine added. \u201cWe\u2019re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,\u201d Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles\u2014or SLS.\n\n\u201cBut if commercial\u2019s not available, what\u2019s the contingency plan?\u201d Aderholt asked again.\n\n\u201cI think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the additional rockets, then we\u2019re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll have those rockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\u201d Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\n\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke\u2019s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we\u2019ll assess their approaches.\u201d\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n\u201cUsing the lift capability of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a \u2018Fewest Steps to the Moon\u2019 approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,\u201d Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the \u201cnational team\u201d led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA\u2019s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don\u2019t know the costs down the road,\u201d Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, \u201cin order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\u201d\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week\u2019s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were \u201ddwindling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA\u2019s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\n----------\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\nRelated: SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018, bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nNASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to compete to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA.

They range from the truly massive \u2014 SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle \u2014 to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we\u2019ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool \u2014 to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n\n\u2022 Moon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\n\u2022 Here's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\n\u2022 NASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story stated that the newly selected companies would build private moon landers for NASA. Their selection makes them eligible to compete for commercial moon lander contracts. Also, while Orbit Beyond stood down from its lander contract earlier this year, the company remains part of the CLPS program and is eligible to compete on future opportunities.\n\nEmail Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him @tariqjmalik.

In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere was no linkage like that,\" she said.\n\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 poll-tested \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquid-pro-quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbribery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Grisham said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpeachment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaccurate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbribery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or any other crime,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she added.\n\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Grisham said.\n\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Vindman said.\n\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Williams said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d she said in response to a question.\n\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Volker said.\n\nDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribe\n\nFollow us on Facebook | Twitter | Dailymotion | YouTube\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWhite House\n\nUkraine\n\nUSA\n\nRelated stories\n\nHow the GOP still banks on Trump's brand for...\n\nPelosi names 2nd GOP critic of Trump to Jan...\n\nTokyo Olympics map corrected after Ukraine objects\n\nVaccinated White House official infected with Covid-19\n\nVaccinated White House official tests Covid positive\n\n2 killed in helicopter crash in Ukraine\n\nWhat's Brewing\n\nIPS officer's 'free biryani' order lands her in soup\n\nChina flooding brought fear, washed away livelihoods\n\nEarth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner core growing more on 1 side \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Here's why\n\nWhy TV audiences are tuning out the Tokyo Olympic Games\n\nUsain, a 'Bolt' from the past\n\nDH Picks\n\nDelta variant may spread as easily as chickenpox: CDC...\n\nKarnataka allows BBMP to impose containment measures\n\nMary Kom says nameless vests deliberate ploy to disturb...\n\nOpposition unity: Mamata needs to tread with caution...\n\nTokyo Olympics: Lovlina guarantees India a second medal...\n\nWhat's Brewing\n\nIPS officer's 'free biryani' order lands her in soup\n\nChina flooding brought fear, washed away livelihoods\n\nEarth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner core growing more on 1 side \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Here's why\n\nWhy TV audiences are tuning out the Tokyo Olympic Games\n\nUsain, a 'Bolt' from the past\n\nWhat does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 North and Central\n\u2022 South\n\u2022 East and Northeast\n\u2022 West\n\nKarnataka\n\n\u2022 Top Stories\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n\u2022 Top Stories\n\u2022 Bengaluru Crime\n\u2022 Politics\n\u2022 Infrastructure\n\u2022 Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n\u2022 Cricket\n\u2022 Formula 1 with DH\n\u2022 Football\n\u2022 Tennis\n\u2022 Sportscene\n\u2022 Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n\u2022 Business News\n\u2022 Family Finance\n\u2022 Technology\n\u2022 DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n\u2022 Videos\n\u2022 Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n\u2022 DH Views\n\u2022 Editorials\n\u2022 Panorama\n\u2022 Comment\n\u2022 In Perspective\n\u2022 Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n\u2022 Entertainment News\n\u2022 DH Showtime\n\u2022 DH Talkies\n\u2022 Arts, Books & Culture\n\nAssam-Mizoram border tensions escalate\n\nSpike in Bengaluru Covid-19 cases\n\nStudy on mixing Covaxin, Covishield recommended\n\nOpposition Unity: Mamata not alone\n\nTokyo Olympics updates\n\nDH Picks\n\n\u2022 Delta variant may spread as easily as chickenpox: CDC\n\u2022 Karnataka allows BBMP to impose containment measures\n\u2022 Mary Kom says nameless vests deliberate ploy to disturb\n\u2022 Opposition unity: Mamata needs to tread with caution\n\u2022 Tokyo Olympics: Lovlina guarantees India a second medal\n\nLatest stories\n\n\u2022 New Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai meets PM Modi\n\u2022 Covid-19 hits demand for Sabarimala priest post\n\u2022 Thackeray, Fadnavis cross paths in flood-hit Kolhapur\n\u2022 Four ideas for a potential follow up to 'Sarpatta'\n\u2022 Fiscal deficit touch 18.2% of annual target in June-end\n\nTrending news\n\n\u2022 Real estate firm\u00c2\u00a0winds up overnight, owner absconding\n\u2022 Veteran Kannada actor Jayanthi no more\n\u2022 'Itching gang' back in action; techie loses Rs 7 lakh\n\u2022 BSY announces resignation as Karnataka Chief Minister\n\u2022 How Raj Kundra rose as a business tycoon\n\nDownload DH APP\n\n\u2022 Services\n\n\u2022 About\n\u2022 Epaper\n\u2022 Archives\n\u2022 Sitemap\n\u2022 Classifieds\n\u2022 Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n\u2022 Printers Mysore\n\u2022 Prajavani\n\u2022 Sudha\n\u2022 Mayura\n\nDownload DH APP\n\n\u2022\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Terms\n\u2022 Disclaimer\n\u2022 Grievance Redressal\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another\u00c2\u00a0HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren\u2019t always the right gift.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I\u2019ve received for testing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d new technology that I\u2019m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I\u2019m grateful for this year.\n\nSatechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it\u2019s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit\u00c2\u00a0while charging in the car.\n\nSatechi\u2019s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I\u2019ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even during use.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I\u2019m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\n\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\n\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\nIt\u2019s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\n\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\n\nRAVPower\u2019s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\n\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it\u2019s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple\u2019s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\n\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nWhile no one has matched Apple\u2019s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\n\nMophie\u2019s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It\u2019s not cheap at $140, but it\u2019s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\n\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\nPrior to Mophie\u2019s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad\u2019s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie\u2019s personally. If you don\u2019t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat\u00c2\u00a0with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\n\nEven with Apple\u2019s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods, Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\n\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn\u2019t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\n\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200\u00c2\u00a0before\u00c2\u00a0you factor the cost of a new TV.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\n\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year.\u00c2\u00a0Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\n\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we\u2019re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop\u00c2\u00a0Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack.\n\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\n\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn\u2019t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside the $99\u00c2\u00a0Logitech\u2019s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\n\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple\u2019s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple\u2019s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\nThen there\u2019s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I\u2019m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\n\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it\u2019s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\n\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even after a keyboard repair.\n\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio. iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven\u2019t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\n\nIt may not be\u00c2\u00a0for me, but it\u2019s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\nPublished November 18, 2019.

Credit: SpaceX\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nNASA said the five companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201d had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\nThis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on-ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\n\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Shotwell, referring to NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial cargo capability.\n\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice stepping stone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to later crewed missions. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d before flying any missions with people on board.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\n\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Space exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He said his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to start with something smaller,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He declined to say when his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lander would be ready.\n\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later, citing internal business issues.\n\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sometime soon\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliveries\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\nCommercial\tBlue OriginCeres RoboticsCLPSlunar landerSierra Nevada Corp.SpaceXTyvak\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nsearch\n\nSearch\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSee Allarrow\n\nDec\t01\n\n8th Space Resiliency Summit\n\nDec\t13\n\nWorld Satellite Business Week\n\nDec\t13\n\nSPACETIDE 2021 Winter in Nihonbashi\n\nSpaceNews\n\n2021 Spacenews, Inc.

He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\n\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\nFollowing Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\n\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\n\nTags:USSwedishUKWikileaksUS Justice DepartmentJulian AssangeEva-Marie Persson\n\nVia SyndiGate.info\n\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2021 Press TV.

And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\nXi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass disorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security impotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's regime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine right of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to lead.\n\nTo be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want to send the army into Hong Kong.\n\nThey know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure otherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel Macron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither can Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party appears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears: resistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its global agenda.\n\nAnd Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and manifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to Beijing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of communications \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence. But Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the protesters into new resistance.\n\nNor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the protests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to fall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A recent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal by the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively independent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between authoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\nAt the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are deluding themselves.\n\nUnlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the American-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not years. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of individual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his Chinese dream . Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a year or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi will choose the former.\n\nIn short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nChina\n\nXi Jinping\n\nHong Kong\n\nProtests\n\nBeijing\n\n\u2022 Share your thoughts with friends.\n\nMore Washington Examiner\n\nAre we going to let the omicron variant become another lockdown excuse?\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nIt's hard to believe the world is fast approaching the two-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic. This has included the initial wave of COVID-19 and more than one variant, including delta, which caused a surge in cases and deaths. It's only natural to wonder if omicron could be the next delta, but early reports are good.\n\n'Abortion bans are racist': Activists protest Dobbs Supreme Court case\n\nLuke Gentile\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\n\"Abortion bans are racist!\"\n\nA post-Roe abortion political 'revolution' is unlikely\n\nMichael Barone\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Supreme Court, as this is being written, is hearing oral arguments in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Organization, challenging Mississippi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law banning, with a few exceptions, abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a powerful argument that the court cannot logically uphold this statute, which is less restrictive than most other nations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 abortion laws, without overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that overturned all 50 states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 abortion laws.\n\nIs Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer the new 'Angel of Death'?\n\nChristopher Tremoglie\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nIn August, Vanity Fair published an article labeling Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the \"Angel of Death\" because of increased COVID-19 infections. The narrative was that DeSantis was an incompetent governor whose policies led to an \"unnecessary\" increase in deaths.\n\nJerome Powell helped cause the inflation he now admits is not merely 'transitory'\n\nQuin Hillyer\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom President Joe Biden bizarrely wants to reappoint for another four-year term, made his own incompetence crystal clear on Tuesday by belatedly acknowledging that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rampant inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\u009d after all.\n\nOther Senate Democrats face risks in voting for Build Back Better\n\nMoshe Hill\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \"Build Back Better\" legislation is on the docket for the Senate.\n\nHow the bipartisan Keep Nine initiative aims to protect the Supreme Court\n\nMarc Ang\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe recent discussions about court-packing have given momentum to the bipartisan Keep Nine initiative. Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike have come together to oppose this short-sighted move, garnering support from key groups from even the far Left.\n\nPelosi's Jan. 6 committee lacks integrity\n\nReps. Andy Biggs, Scott Perry, Jody Hice, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Scott DesJarlais, Mary Miller, Clay Higgins, and Andrew Clyde\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe recent revelation that Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jan. 6 committee issued a subpoena based on blatant lies is just one more indication of that mob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illegitimacy. The train of abuses includes stacking the committee with Trump-haters and belligerently biased members of Congress, removing Republicans from the committee who were appointed by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, and issuing a bogus contempt citation of Steve Bannon, who was awaiting a judicial determination on former President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim of executive privilege.\n\nHHS sacrifices freedoms for far-left agenda\n\nMatt Bowman\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Biden administration is at it again. Beginning on Nov. 18, the Department of Health and Human Services revealed a series of reversals of multiple Trump administration policies that protected religious freedom from government mandates.\n\nPentagon misses opportunity with Global Posture Review\n\nSean Durns\n\nWednesday December 01, 2021\n\nThe Defense Department announced on Monday that it has concluded its Global Posture Review. The review is a worldwide assessment of U.S. military bases, access arrangements, and forces. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said it will \"improve our global response capability and inform the draft of the next National Defense Strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nTwitter's new CEO doesn't understand the website's real problems\n\nZachary Faria\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nIt was a near certainty that whoever replaced Jack Dorsey as the CEO of Twitter would be worse than him. Given what we know about new CEO Parag Agrawal, it looks like that possibility has been realized.\n\nBiden should extend a state visit invitation to Lithuania\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nPresident Joe Biden should extend the invitation of a state visit to President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania.\n\nEU demands proof missing Chinese tennis player is safe\n\nAsher Notheis\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nThe European Union demanded on Tuesday China release \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verifiable proof\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the safety of tennis player Peng Shuai, who disappeared earlier this month.\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo has forfeited all legitimacy as a journalist\n\nQuin Hillyer\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nCNN should fire prime-time host Chris Cuomo \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not just for its own ethical hygiene, but to uphold journalistic standards writ large and to avoid further eroding public trust in the media.\n\nWhy I'm running to be a senator from Pennsylvania\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nWe are angry at our government and at each other.\n\nBritain's MI6 chief shifts focus to China\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 30, 2021\n\nOn Tuesday, the British spy chief issued a stark warning over China.\n\nAbout Examiner\n\nMagazine Archive\n\nStaff\n\nPolicies and Standards\n\nSitemap\n\nAdvertise\n\nContact\n\nSubscribe\n\nNewsletters\n\nCareers\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTerms Of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCopyright 2021.

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\n\nAccording to The Verge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a statement\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\nYouTube on Android TV Now Has a Proper Playlist UI\n\nWhen streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\n\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's revealed in Eurogamer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\n\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terrible. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles, \u00c2\u00a0it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad alternative. That said, Google promised more, and for whatever reason, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not delivering yet. Hopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience soon.\n\nThe Google Stadia Founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Premiere Editions, which come with a Chromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

Legg, Ph.D., CRNP \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Updated on November 14, 2019\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating disorder in the United States (1).\n\nBED is about more than food, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recognized psychological condition. That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame.\n\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try \u00e2\u20ac\u201d both at home and with the help of a professional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n1. Ditch the diet\n\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes.\n\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.\n\nSummary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.\n\n2. Avoid skipping meals\n\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\nSummary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.\n\n3. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.\n\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.\n\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\nSummary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.\n\n4. Stay hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.\n\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17 ounces (375\u00e2\u20ac\u201c500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\nOther studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss (10, 11).\n\nThe amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying well hydrated.\n\nSummary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating.\n\n5. Try yoga\n\nYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation.\n\nStudies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating.\n\nOne small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\nAnother study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\nResearch also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\nTry joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\nSummary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.\n\n6. Eat more fiber\n\nFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer (16).\n\nSome research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake.\n\nOne small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness (17).\n\nAnother study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\nFruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full.\n\nSummary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger.\n\n7. Clean out the kitchen\n\nHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat.\n\nConversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\nStart by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\nStocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods.\n\nSummary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat.\n\n8. Start hitting the gym\n\nStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating.\n\nFor instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\nAnother study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\nPlus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\nWalking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating.\n\nSummary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels.\n\n9. Eat breakfast every day\n\nStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day.\n\nSeveral studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\nPlus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\nFor example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast (22).\n\nMeanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\nTry combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\nSummary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.\n\n10. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating.\n\nIn fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition (24).\n\nAnother large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight (25).\n\nAim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\nSummary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite.\n\n11. Keep a food and mood journal\n\nKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\nOne study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating (26).\n\nSeveral other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to increased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\nTo get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day using either a journal or app.\n\nSummary Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.\n\n12. Find someone to talk to\n\nTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.\n\nOne study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that reliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\nAnother study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was linked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\nA good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which may help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32, 33).\n\nNext time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted friend or family member. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have someone to talk to, eating disorder helplines are available free of charge.\n\nSummary A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge eating and stress.\n\n13. Increase your protein intake\n\nUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help control your appetite.\n\nOne study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\nSimilarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced metabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite (35).\n\nTry including at least one good source of protein \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\nSummary Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1, a hormone that can help suppress appetite.\n\n14. Plan meals\n\nPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to prepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the remainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\nIn fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of obesity (36).\n\nMeal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which has been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nSet aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your meals.\n\nSummary Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.\n\n15. Seek help\n\nWhile the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan designed by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\nTreatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to help get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then develops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\nOther types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy (37).\n\nAntidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications (38, 39).\n\nSummary Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain medications can also be used.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around the world.\n\nHowever, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and healthy lifestyle modifications.\n\nEditor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s note: This piece was originally published on Sept. 17, 2018.

News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an insider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have operational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bad Blood\u00e2\u20ac\u009d songstress allegedly hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been returning Braun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN, BIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT\n\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on June 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ithaca Holdings)\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAs\n\nA LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT'S FEUDS\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\nVideo\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\nBraun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fearless\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and 2014\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u01531989.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP)\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management team. We have no further comment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\nVideo\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING' CLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\nVideo\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 request for comment.\n\nFox News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.\n\nJulius\u00c2\u00a0is an LA Entertainment Reporter for Fox News.\n\nTrending\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nAlec Baldwin to discuss 'Rust' shooting in 'raw,' 'very candid' TV interview\n\nExclusive\n\nKathie Lee Gifford talks cancel culture, forgiving Frank Gifford after infidelity: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt almost destroyed me\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n\nCelebrity News\n\nMegan Thee Stallion cancels performance citing Astroworld Festival tragedy: 'Houston is still healing'\n\n2:14\n\nVIDEO\n\nFox News Flash top entertainment headlines for December 1\n\nCelebrity News\n\nDolph Lundgren talks new action movie 'Castle Falls' and working with his daughter Ida\n\nThe Bachelor\n\n'Bachelor' Season 26 announces Clayton Echard as its new leading man\n\nCoronavirus\n\nU.S.\n\n\u2022 Crime\n\u2022 Military\n\u2022 Education\n\u2022 Terror\n\u2022 Immigration\n\u2022 Economy\n\u2022 Personal Freedoms\n\u2022 Fox News Investigates\n\nWorld\n\n\u2022 U.N.\n\u2022 Conflicts\n\u2022 Terrorism\n\u2022 Disasters\n\u2022 Global Economy\n\u2022 Environment\n\u2022 Religion\n\u2022 Scandals\n\nOpinion\n\nPolitics\n\n\u2022 Executive\n\u2022 Senate\n\u2022 House\n\u2022 Judiciary\n\u2022 Foreign Policy\n\u2022 Polls\n\u2022 Elections\n\nEntertainment\n\n\u2022 Celebrity News\n\u2022 Movies\n\u2022 TV News\n\u2022 Music News\n\u2022 Style News\n\u2022 Entertainment Video\n\nBusiness\n\n\u2022 Personal Finance\n\u2022 Economy\n\u2022 Markets\n\u2022 Watchlist\n\u2022 Lifestyle\n\u2022 Real Estate\n\u2022 Tech\n\nLifestyle\n\n\u2022 Food + Drink\n\u2022 Cars + Trucks\n\u2022 Travel + Outdoors\n\u2022 House + Home\n\u2022 Fitness + Well-being\n\u2022 Style + Beauty\n\u2022 Family\n\u2022 Faith\n\nScience\n\n\u2022 Archaeology\n\u2022 Air & Space\n\u2022 Planet Earth\n\u2022 Wild Nature\n\u2022 Natural Science\n\u2022 Dinosaurs\n\nTech\n\n\u2022 Security\n\u2022 Innovation\n\u2022 Drones\n\u2022 Computers\n\u2022 Video Games\n\u2022 Military Tech\n\nHealth\n\n\u2022 Coronavirus\n\u2022 Healthy Living\n\u2022 Medical Research\n\u2022 Mental Health\n\u2022 Cancer\n\u2022 Heart Health\n\u2022 Children's Health\n\nTV\n\n\u2022 Shows\n\u2022 Personalities\n\u2022 Watch Live\n\u2022 Full Episodes\n\u2022 Show Clips\n\u2022 News Clips\n\nAbout\n\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Careers\n\u2022 Fox Around the World\n\u2022 Advertise With Us\n\u2022 Media Relations\n\u2022 Corporate Information\n\u2022 Compliance\n\u2022 Supplier Diversity\n\nOther\n\n\u2022 Fox Weather\n\u2022 Fox Nation\n\u2022 Fox News Shop\n\u2022 Fox News Go\n\u2022 Fox News Radio\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Podcasts\n\u2022 Apps & Products\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Instagram\n\u2022 Youtube\n\u2022 Flipboard\n\u2022 LinkedIn\n\u2022 Slack\n\u2022 RSS\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Spotify\n\u2022 iHeartRadio\n\nFox News\n\n\u2022 New Terms of Use\n\u2022 New Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Do Not Sell my Personal Information\n\u2022 Closed Captioning Policy\n\u2022 Help\n\u2022 Contact Us\n\u2022 Accessibility Statement\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00c2\u00a92021 FOX News Network, LLC.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\n\nI know \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it all looks so good. But you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat it all, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to set priorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those that are vegetable-based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live without and leave it at that.\n\n2. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to drink water\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there.\n\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s especially true when you\u2019re watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and without realizing it, you\u2019ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying your food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n4. \u201cVeggie-fy\u201d your chips \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dip\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip.\n\nBut instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a vegetable instead.\n\nBecause let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\nHealthy Game Day Dip:\u00c2\u00a0Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories.\n\nEnjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get plenty of tangy crunch \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without all the calories.\n\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saving nearly 100 calories \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats?\n\nThis is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself \u201cno.\u201d That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I always tell my clients: \u201cAn open face is a happy face!\u201d\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without overdoing it!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWeight Loss\n\nIs It Possible to Cycle Your Way to Weight Loss?\n\nWeight Loss\n\nWhat Is a \u201cMuffin Top\u201d and How Do I Get Rid of It?\n\nWeight Loss\n\nMenopause and Weight Gain: What You Need to Know\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nInstagram\n\nJoin our newsletter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nInstagram\n\nJoin our newsletter\n\nThe information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community pages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a US audience.

Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n\nRead More\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\n\nSearch\n\n\u2022 World\n\n\u2022 Africa\n\u2022 Americas\n\u2022 Asia\n\u2022 Australia\n\u2022 China\n\u2022 Europe\n\u2022 India\n\u2022 Middle East\n\u2022 United Kingdom\n\n\u2022 US Politics\n\n\u2022 The Biden Presidency\n\u2022 Facts First\n\u2022 US Elections\n\n\u2022 Business\n\n\u2022 Markets\n\u2022 Tech\n\u2022 Media\n\u2022 Success\n\u2022 Perspectives\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Health\n\n\u2022 Life, But Better\n\u2022 Fitness\n\u2022 Food\n\u2022 Sleep\n\u2022 Mindfulness\n\u2022 Relationships\n\n\u2022 Entertainment\n\n\u2022 Stars\n\u2022 Screen\n\u2022 Binge\n\u2022 Culture\n\u2022 Media\n\n\u2022 Tech\n\n\u2022 Innovate\n\u2022 Gadget\n\u2022 Foreseeable Future\n\u2022 Mission: Ahead\n\u2022 Upstarts\n\u2022 Work Transformed\n\u2022 Innovative Cities\n\n\u2022 Style\n\n\u2022 Arts\n\u2022 Design\n\u2022 Fashion\n\u2022 Architecture\n\u2022 Luxury\n\u2022 Beauty\n\u2022 Video\n\n\u2022 Travel\n\n\u2022 Destinations\n\u2022 Food and Drink\n\u2022 Stay\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Sports\n\n\u2022 Football\n\u2022 Tennis\n\u2022 Golf\n\u2022 Tokyo 2020\n\u2022 US Sports\n\u2022 Climbing\n\u2022 Motorsport\n\u2022 Formula E\n\u2022 Esports\n\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Live TV\n\u2022 Digital Studios\n\u2022 CNN Films\n\u2022 HLN\n\u2022 TV Schedule\n\u2022 TV Shows A-Z\n\u2022 CNNVR\n\n\u2022 Features\n\n\u2022 As Equals\n\u2022 Call to Earth\n\u2022 Freedom Project\n\u2022 Impact Your World\n\u2022 Inside Africa\n\u2022 2 Degrees\n\u2022 CNN Heroes\n\u2022 All Features\n\n\u2022 Weather\n\n\u2022 Climate\n\u2022 Storm Tracker\n\u2022 Wildfire Tracker\n\u2022 Video\n\n\u2022 More\n\n\u2022 Photos\n\u2022 Longform\n\u2022 Investigations\n\u2022 CNN Profiles\n\u2022 CNN Leadership\n\u2022 CNN Newsletters\n\u2022 Work for CNN\n\n----------\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 ----------\n\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Accessibility & CC\n\u2022 Ad Choices\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Modern Slavery Act Statement\n\u2022 Advertise with us\n\u2022 CNN Store\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Transcripts\n\u2022 License Footage\n\u2022 CNN Newsource\n\u2022 Sitemap\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.A Warner Media Company.All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans \u00e2\u201e\u00a2 & \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Cable News Network."

Anthony Gonzalez told CNN's Jake Tapper something over the weekend that crystallized a question I keep coming back to when it comes to the Republican party's continuing loyalty to former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The cold hard truth is Donald Trump led us into a ditch on January 6,\" Gonzalez, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his conduct on January 6, told Tapper. \"The former President lied to us. He lied to every one of us and in doing so he cost (Republicans) the House, the Senate and the White House.\"\n\nYes! This!\n\nPolitics has always been a bit of a rough game. Politicians who win -- and help others win -- are lauded. Those who don't, well, aren't. It's transactional.\n\nThat reality is why I assumed that following Trump's 2020 loss, there would be a significant reckoning within the party about the last four years -- and a turning away from Trump.\n\nRead More\n\nAfter all, that he oversaw -- and contributed to -- Republican losses is indisputable.\n\nIn 2018, Republicans lost 40 House seats -- and the House majority -- in an election that Democrats successfully turned into a referendum on Trump. (That Trump's approval ratings was stuck in the low 40s in the run-up to that election effectively sealed Republicans' fate.)\n\nTwo years later, Trump not only lost the presidency convincingly but also likely cost Republicans their Senate majority by spending the months after the election talking almost exclusively about (his lie of) how he was cheated out of victory. Democrats won two runoffs in Georgia while Trump was distracting the party base and, in so doing, recaptured the Senate majority.\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nSo, Trump came into office in 2016 with Republicans in the majority in the House and Senate. He left office in 2020 with Republicans totally out of power in the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThat record of losses should -- if history was any guide -- leave such a stench of defeat around Trump that no one in the party would want to be around him much less have him as their de facto leader.\n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nThe most obvious explanation for how Trump has managed to win despite losing is that he, well, never admits that he has lost.\n\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Trump tweeted that he had \"received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night.\" Later he tweeted that \"those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 loss, Trump has spent months propagating the lie that there was widespread voter fraud that cost him a win. (Note: There wasn't.)\n\nTrump's willingness to say up is down -- and for large parts of the Republican base to take his word for it -- appears to have created an ahistoric moment for the Republican party: They are following a man who oversaw widespread setbacks for the party over the last four years. And more than that: They want him to run for president again in 2024!\n\nSearch\n\n\u2022 World\n\n\u2022 Africa\n\u2022 Americas\n\u2022 Asia\n\u2022 Australia\n\u2022 China\n\u2022 Europe\n\u2022 India\n\u2022 Middle East\n\u2022 United Kingdom\n\n\u2022 US Politics\n\n\u2022 The Biden Presidency\n\u2022 Facts First\n\u2022 US Elections\n\n\u2022 Business\n\n\u2022 Markets\n\u2022 Tech\n\u2022 Media\n\u2022 Success\n\u2022 Perspectives\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Health\n\n\u2022 Life, But Better\n\u2022 Fitness\n\u2022 Food\n\u2022 Sleep\n\u2022 Mindfulness\n\u2022 Relationships\n\n\u2022 Entertainment\n\n\u2022 Stars\n\u2022 Screen\n\u2022 Binge\n\u2022 Culture\n\u2022 Media\n\n\u2022 Tech\n\n\u2022 Innovate\n\u2022 Gadget\n\u2022 Foreseeable Future\n\u2022 Mission: Ahead\n\u2022 Upstarts\n\u2022 Work Transformed\n\u2022 Innovative Cities\n\n\u2022 Style\n\n\u2022 Arts\n\u2022 Design\n\u2022 Fashion\n\u2022 Architecture\n\u2022 Luxury\n\u2022 Beauty\n\u2022 Video\n\n\u2022 Travel\n\n\u2022 Destinations\n\u2022 Food and Drink\n\u2022 Stay\n\u2022 News\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Sports\n\n\u2022 Football\n\u2022 Tennis\n\u2022 Golf\n\u2022 Tokyo 2020\n\u2022 US Sports\n\u2022 Climbing\n\u2022 Motorsport\n\u2022 Formula E\n\u2022 Esports\n\n\u2022 Videos\n\n\u2022 Live TV\n\u2022 Digital Studios\n\u2022 CNN Films\n\u2022 HLN\n\u2022 TV Schedule\n\u2022 TV Shows A-Z\n\u2022 CNNVR\n\n\u2022 Features\n\n\u2022 As Equals\n\u2022 Call to Earth\n\u2022 Freedom Project\n\u2022 Impact Your World\n\u2022 Inside Africa\n\u2022 2 Degrees\n\u2022 CNN Heroes\n\u2022 All Features\n\n\u2022 Weather\n\n\u2022 Climate\n\u2022 Storm Tracker\n\u2022 Wildfire Tracker\n\u2022 Video\n\n\u2022 More\n\n\u2022 Photos\n\u2022 Longform\n\u2022 Investigations\n\u2022 CNN Profiles\n\u2022 CNN Leadership\n\u2022 CNN Newsletters\n\u2022 Work for CNN\n\n----------\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 ----------\n\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 Accessibility & CC\n\u2022 Ad Choices\n\u2022 About Us\n\u2022 Modern Slavery Act Statement\n\u2022 Advertise with us\n\u2022 CNN Store\n\u2022 Newsletters\n\u2022 Transcripts\n\u2022 License Footage\n\u2022 CNN Newsource\n\u2022 Sitemap\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.A Warner Media Company.All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans \u00e2\u201e\u00a2 & \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Cable News Network."

Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics.

Kathrin Ziegler/Getty\n\n\u2022 If you're planning to retire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated annual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher depending on the lifestyle you envision.\n\u2022 Depending on how much you plan to spend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial independence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE.\n\u2022 To achieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and max out your retirement accounts.\n\u2022 You should also aim to pay off all high-interest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage early. And don't forget to make a backup plan.\n\u2022 Visit Business Insider's Investing Reference library for more stories.\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\n\nHow to retire early\n\n1. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live \u00e2\u20ac\u201d i.e. financial independence \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n2. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n\n3. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n4. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n\n5. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's a short-term solution \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not including any earnings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d tax-free, at any time.\n\n7. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who only goes by his first name online \u00e2\u20ac\u201d retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n9. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if available to you \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n\n10. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement \u00e2\u20ac\u201d would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n11.

At least one of the thieves was wearing an orange wig, and they fled in a car, KABC reported.\n\nAlso Wednesday, police said at least four people stole $20,000 worth of merchandise from an Apple store in Santa Rosa, located about 55 miles north of San Francisco.\n\n\"In a brazen daytime burglary in front of customers and staff, the suspects grabbed over $20,000 worth of merchandise from the store and fled the area in an unknown vehicle,\" Santa Rosa police said.\n\nThe suspects were between the ages of 14 and 18 and wore masks, police said.\n\nThe thefts come amid a recent wave of burglaries in which several or many thieves strike a store at once.\n\nOn Monday, at least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store at the Grove in Los Angeles and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, LAPD Chief Michel Moore said. Three people were arrested, he said.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, a group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing. And east of San Francisco, three suspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob of about 80 people ransacked a Nordstrom department store in Walnut Creek, police said.\n\nNot all targets have been high-end stores. In San Francisco on Friday night, a Walgreens and cannabis dispensaries were robbed in a similar fashion, in addition to a Louis Vuitton store, a Burberry store, a jewelry store and a Bloomingdale's, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nIn Oakland last weekend, \"armed roving caravans ... targeted dozens of businesses, including pharmacies, retail shops and a large number of cannabis operations,\" Oakland police said in a news release.\n\nIn suburban Chicago, 14 people barged into a Louis Vuitton store last week and fled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise, according to CNN affiliate WLS, citing Oak Brook police.\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.
